    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the linear model is the basis of many statistical and machine learning models. Further, an understanding of linear models is a good basis for understand many other types of statistical and machine learning models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will focus on regression models, but the lessons drawn from this discussion can be applied to many other types of models. By developing an understanding of linear regression, you are building a foundation to understand many other machine learning models. Nearly all machine learning methods suffer from the same problems, including over-fitting and mathematically unstable fitting methods. Understanding these problems in the linear regression context will help you work with other machine learning models.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of regression is one of the oldest and most widely used analytics methods. The goal of regression is to produce a model that represents the **best fit** to some observed data. Typically the model is a function describing some type of curve (lines, parabolas, etc.) that is determined by a set of parameters (e.g., slope and intercept). *Best fit* means that there is an optimal set of parameters which minimize an error criteria we choose.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning models, including some of the latest deep learning methods, are a form of regression. **Linear regression** is the foundational form of regression. Linear regression minimizes squared error of the predictions of the dependent variable using the values of the independent variables. This approach is know as the **method of least squares**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression models attempt to predict the value of one variable using the values of other variable. Unfortunately, the terminology used for these variables is not consistent across authors, statistical software packages, and application domains. The table below list some, but by no means all of the terms used for these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusing terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that linear models have been developed in many areas of a long period of times, different terminology has developed for the same things. For people trying to learn the subject this differing terminology is confusing and seemingly conflicting.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The main division in terminology arises from different communities within statistics and machine learning. The table below shows some of the different terms commonly used in the two lineages:       \n",

One difference in terminology is the naming of the variables used in regression and other machine learning models. The table below outlines some of these differences:          \n",

    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is based on the method of least squares or the method of minimum mean square error. The idea of averaging errors have been applied for nearly three centuries. The fist known publication of a *method of averages* was by the German astronomer Tobias Mayer in 1750. Lapace used a similar method which he published in 1788.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/TobiasMayer.jpg\" alt=\"TobiasMayer\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first publication of the **method or least squares** was by the French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805. Legendre was a brilliant mathematician, known for his unpleasant personality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/Legendre.jpg)\n",
    "<center>Caricature of Legendre, published method of least squares</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very likely that the German physicist and mathematician Gauss developed the method of least squares as early as 1795, but did not publish the method until 1809, aside from a reference in a letter in 1799. Gauss never disputed Legendre's priority in publication. Legendre did not return the favor, and opposed any notion that Gauss had used the method earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.jpg)\n",
    "<center>Carl Friedrich Gauss, early adopter of the least squares method</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first use of the term **regression** was by Francis Gaulton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, in 1886. Gaulton was interested in determining which traits of plants and animals, including humans, could be said to be inherited. Gaulton used the term **regression to the mean** to describe the natural processes he observed in inherited traits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/Francis_Galton.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:225px; height:250px\"/>\n",
    "<center>Francis Galton, inventor of regression</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gaulton invented a modern form regression, it fell to Karl Pearson to put regression and multiple regression on a firm mathematical footing. Pearson's 1898 publication proposed a method of regression as we understand it today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many others have expanded the theory of regression in the 120 years since Pearson's paper. Notably, Joseph Berkson published the logistic regression method in 1944, one of the first classification algorithms. In recent times the interest in machine learning has lead to a rapid increase in the numbers and types of regression models. "

In other words, the variance is a function of the predicted values, $\\sigma(x_i) = f(x_i)$.
