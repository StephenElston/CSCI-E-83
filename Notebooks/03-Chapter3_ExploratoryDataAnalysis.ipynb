    "# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should you learn about exploratory data analysis (EDA)? And, why discuss this topic in a book on computational statistics? Simply put, understanding the data you are working on is an essential step in any data science project. By exploring your data you gain understanding of the relationships in the data; what seems important, what might not be. A good understanding of your data set can save you quite a lot of time by focusing your efforts in the right direction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can define EDA as exploring complex data sets, using summary statistics and visualization, to develop understanding of the inherent relationships. Why is the focus here on visualization? Most people have excellent visual perception. Therefore, visualization is a key technique in exploratory data analysis. Not only that, a few good visualizations are a powerful way to communicate your insights to your colleagues. And, communications is a critical step in the data science process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all data science projects require model building of some type: an inferential model, a predictive machine learning model, or a decision model. In any event, before constructing any type of model, you should develop an understanding of the relationships in the data set. Skipping this step can waste a lot of time from unexpected problems when building models. This point underscores how important EDA is. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is used at every stage of good computational statistics practice. In this chapter, we will explore some basic concepts. In the next two chapters we will examine both visualization practice to improve human perception and visualization methods for large and complex data sets. In the remaining parts of this book we will use summary statistics and visualization methods not only for initial exploration of data, but also to evaluate and improve models.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## The EDA Process\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we say about the EDA process? EDA is inherently an iterative process. As the name implies, the results of any exploration are unknown before the process commences. In general, EDA will progress from the simplest of observations to generating some very specific and complex insights about the problem at hand. As you proceed you will **develop multiple views** of the relationships between the variables of complex data. Some of these views contribute significantly to your understanding. But be prepared, many views you create will not be very useful. This is an exporatory process after all!    \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is undesirable, in fact impossible, to follow a pre-defined recipe for a given analysis. **Good EDA practice is relentlessly iterative**, and requires much trial and error. Most ideas tested will not work, but some will, and are therefore quite valuable. In summary, when performing EDA, plan on doing some significant trial and error work.   \n",
    "\n",
    "While we cannot define a specific recipe or process flow for EDA, we can define the components of the EDA process. These general components will be repeated many times, in an order determined by the state of the analysis. The state of the analysis being what you have learned and still need to learn about your data at any point in time. The key components of EDA are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summary statistics help develop an overall initial understanding of the properties of the data. As the process continues, summary statistics can be used to help guide the exploration. \n",
    "2. Using appropriate chart types to create multiple views of the data. These views highlight different aspects of the inherent relationships between the variables.\n",
    "3. Identify and correct problems with the pre-processing or preparation of the data. It is often the case that problems like missing data, incorrectly coded values, erroneous values and the like are discovered during the EDA process. \n",
    "4. Evaluate and improve models using a combination of summary statistics and visualization. We will take up this component of the process in Part 4 of this book. \n",
    "5. Continue the above steps to find important relationships between the variables. Likewise, it is common to discover that some relationships are not, in fact, important. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic ideas of using a combination of summary statistics and charts to explore the data is several centuries old. This process was often ad hoc and not studied seriously until the late 20th Century. In fact, academic statistics thought most of the 20th century was focused almost exclusively on the mathematical aspects of statistics, rather than data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19th Century Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Several pioneers of exploratory graphics worked in the late 18th and early 19th Centuries. For example, @Tufte credits **William Playfair** with being the first person to systematically use visualization to explore data. Playfair was a colorful character, known for his work in engineering and economics, as well as, being a spy for the British Government. Interest in Playfair's work continues in our present century. See for example, @Spence_Howard.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphics played a significant role in 19th century statistics. Before many of now commonly used mathematical methods were developed, graphical analysis was a primary tool. These analyses included pioneering work in medical statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Florence Nightingale was a 19th Century innovator in medical data analysis [@Nightingale]. @McDonald_2020 describes her work with the noted medical statistician Dr William Farr. Nightingale and Farr documented the effect of implementing the recommendations of the Royal Sanitary Commission on reducing deaths of British soldiers during the Crimean War (1855-1856). Nightingale wrote several reports on the subject, the last of which included the area chart shown below. You can see the dramatic reduction in deaths after March 1855.   \n",

He created the map shown below to identify water from a specific pump as the source of the infections.

    "### EDA in the 20th Century\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the 20th Century data visualization was relegated to a minor role. Mathematical statistics was considered more important and defined the mainstream. The very influential, and now controversial, statistician Ronald A Fisher [@Fisher_1925] [@Fisher_1935] was a proponent of charting data. However, the broader early 20th Century statistics community mostly focused on the mathematical aspects of Fisher's work.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The modern history exploratory data analysis begins with the American statistician, John W Tukey. In the 1960s and 1970s Tukey and his colleagues developed many techniques used today. Tukey consolidated his many ideas on data exploration into a book in the late 1970s [@Tukey].\n",

    "To demonstrate the principles of EDA, we will use an automotive data set in the first parts of this chapter for the running example. The data set contains the characteristics of a number of automobiles. Our goal is to understand how the characteristics of car affect its fuel economy and price.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is from the [University of California Irving Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile)  The data was compiled by Jeffrey C. Schlimmer from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1985 Model Import Car and Truck Specifications, 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook. \n",
    "- Personal Auto Manuals, Insurance Services Office, 160 Water Street, New York, NY 10038 \n",

    "\n",
    "### Importing and preparing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to load the data set. While this is not a book about 'data munging' or Python programming we do need to perform some data preparation before moving to EDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code shown below loads the data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Several steps required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the Python packages required for the rest of this chapter. \n",
    "2. Load the data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. \n",
    "3. Give the columns of the data frame useful and Python-friendly names. These names use the `_` character, and avoid characters like `.` and `-` having meaning to a Python interpreter. \n",
    "4. Rows with missing values are removed. While other treatments of missing values are possible, we take the simple approach here. The missing values are coded with a `?` character. Any value of `?` is replaced with a Numpy `nan` and the Pandas [`dropna`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) method is applied to the data frame. \n",
    "5. Finally, some columns which should contain numeric values, but are coded as character strings, are coerced to the correct type. \n"

    "There are a great many summary statistics used in statistics, many of them highly specialized. Here, we will only concern ourselves with some of the most commonly used methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum and minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "The **maximum** and **minimum** are simply the extrema of the values of a variable. The range of values is simply computed as, $maximum - minimum$. It is generally useful to know what the range of values are for each numeric variable. This range can be orders of magnitude different from variable to variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unexpectedly large of small values are often a flag that something is wrong with the data. Are some values coded incorrectly? Did a decimal point get misplaced?   \n",

    "The **mean** or average value is the most commonly used summary statistic. The formula to compute the **empirical mean** or **sample mean**, $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$, from a set of n samples $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\}$ is:\n",

    "### Standard deviation and variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is a useful summary statistic but it only provides one summary about the values of a variable. We would like to know other characteristics as well. For example, we would like a measure of the **dispersion** of the values. Simply put, variables with larger dispersion have values spread over a greater range, and vice versa. Therefore, having a measure of dispersion helps you understand the range of values of a variable.     \n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used measure of dispersion is the **standard deviation**, or square root of the sum of the squared differences between the mean and each sample value. For our sample,$\\mathbf{x}$, with mean $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}$, the standard deviation, $\\sigma$, is computed using the following formula. \n",

    "$$\\sigma = sqrt \\Big[ \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}})^2 \\Big]$$    \n",
    " Where, $sqrt$ is the square root. Notice that the denominator for a finite size sample is $n-1$,mean rather than $n$. This is a **bias correction** since 1 degree of freedom is used to compute the mean.    \n",
    " \n",
    " The **variance** is write as, $\\sigma^2$, and is just the square of the standard deviation, $\\sigma^2 = standard\\ deviation^2$. As you will see, the variance is an important property of probability distributions. \n",

    "### Median and quartiles   \n",
    " \n",
    "The median is not the only possible measure of **central tendency**. The **median** is a commonly used alternative. The median is simply the middle value of the ordered sample, $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\}$. The algorithm for computing the median is quite simple. If there is no middle value, the average is taken of the two values nearest the middle.     \n",

    "\n",
    "The **quartiles** are computed by dividing the data samples into 4 equal parts. The quartiles provide a measure of the dispersion of the sample distribution.  The quartiles are computed in a manner identical to the median. You can interpret the quartiles as follows:\n",
    "- One forth of the data samples have values less than the **first (lower) quartile**. \n",
    "- The second quartile is the median. \n",

    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) is a low-level scientific and technical charting package. A number of other Python charting libraries are built on top of Matplotlib. As a result, a bit of knowledge of Matplotlib will help you set the attributes of plots created with several other packages. Using these capabilities, you can create highly customized presentation quality charts. An extensive [tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) is available for Matplotlib.\n",

    "The plot of the Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE) weights was created in a similar manner to the plot of the quantiles. Again, this plot demonstrates some of the flexibility available using calls to Matplotlib.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample data is the same as used for the quantile example. We just need to generate some values for a Gaussian density function to plot by the following steps:       \n",
    "1. The Numpy [`arange`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html) function is used to create evenly spaced horizontal axis values.      \n",
    "2. The ['scipy.stats.norm.pdf`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html) function is used to compute the density values for a Gaussian. Details of what this function computes will be discussed in Part 3 of this book.       \n",

    "\n",
    "- Exploratory data analysis is an iterative process. It is impossible to say at the outset what the entire process is. Next steps are determined by the results obtained previously in the analysis. \n",
    "- EDA is integrated into the modeling process.   \n",
    "- Failure to perform EDA can easily result in constructing models with poor performance. \n",
    "- An initial impression of a data set is obtained using summary statistical methods for both numeric and categorical variables.\n",
    "- Multiple graphical views are used to develop an understanding of different relationships in the data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear there is more one can learn about the data sets discussed here. As is usually the case, the initial EDA has only scratched the surface of the important relationships. \n",
