Creating a visualization that optimizes human perception can highlight important insights. When faced with trying to understand complex data sets the limits of human perception become a significant factor. Applying the results of the considerable research on human perceptions for data visualization can help the process considerably.\n",

By plot aesthetics, we mean properties of a visualization that highlight aspects of the data relationships. Additionally, aesthetics are used to project additional dimensions of complex data onto the 2-dimensional plot surface.  In summary, applying aesthetics with a bit of cleverness can lead to interesting insights about a data set.    \n",
