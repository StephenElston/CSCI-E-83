    "# Introduction to Perception and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will investigate techniques to maximize the information a viewer perceives from data visualizations. Creating a visualization that optimizes human perception can highlight important insights. When faced with trying to understand complex data sets the limits of human perception become a significant factor. Applying the results of the considerable research on human perceptions for data visualization can help the process considerably. \n",
    "   \n",
    "This chapter explores using plot aesthetics to improve the perception of complex relationships. We take a very broad view of the term 'aesthetic' here. By plot aesthetics, we mean properties of a visualization that highlight aspects of the data relationships. Additionally, aesthetics are used to project additional dimensions of complex data onto the 2-dimensional plot surface.  In summary, applying aesthetics with a bit of cleverness can lead to interesting insights about a data set.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In each section of this chapter, we will explore one aspect of using Python visualization tools to effectively understand the relationships in complex data sets. These sections are ordered by how good human perception is for those aesthetics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easy to perceive plot aesthetics:** We will start with generally easy to perceive aesthetics. These aesthetics are the most powerful at enhancing a viewer's perception. If possible, these aesthetics should be preferred when creating visualizations.    \n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Aesthetics with moderate perceptive power:** There are certain aesthetics, that are effective, but only when used within their limits.       \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aesthetics with limited perceptive power:** We will review some commonly used aesthetics that have limited perception power. Such aesthetics must be used sparingly.  Nonetheless, these aesthetics can still be useful in highlighting certain relationships in complex data sets.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many possible plot properties or aesthetics one can use for visualization. This chapter is by no means comprehensive. Specific examples of aesthetics discussed here, the applicable data types, and the relative perceptive power are summarized in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property or Aesthetic |Perception| Data Types |\n",

    "\n",
    "Another possible method of transforming data is to apply a power transformation. The power transform simply raises the values, $v$, of a variable by a power. The power is expressed as the logarithm, $\\lambda$. Several algorithms have been developed to find values of $\\lambda$ for power transformation. These algorithms attempt to find $\\lambda$s that transform the variable to the closest fit to a Normal distribution. The resulting transformation is considered optimal since the relationship between Normally distributed variables tends to be linear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One such transformation is the Box-Cox transform. The Box-Cox algorithm uses logarithmic transformations and is there for suitable variables with values greater than 0. The [sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer.html) function implements both the Box-Cox transformation and the Yeo-Johnson algorithm. \n",

    "\\end{cases}  \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that in this formulation $\\lambda=0$ is the logarithm since $log(1) = 0$. Any values $0 \\gt \\lambda \\lt 1$ are roots of the values $x$. For example, for square root, we get $\\lambda = log(0.5) = -0.69$.  For values $1 \\lt \\lambda \\lt \\infty$ the variable is raised to a power. If $\\lambda$ is negtive the transform is by an inverse power. As another example, if the power is squared, then $\\lambda = log(2.0) = 0.69$, the same absolute value of $\\lambda$ with the opposite sign.  \n",
