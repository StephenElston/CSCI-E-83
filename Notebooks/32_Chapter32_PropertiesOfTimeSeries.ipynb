    "\n",
    "Time series data are different from the data types we have encountered so far. Up until now, we have been able to construct models using the assumption of **independent and identically distributed (iid) errors**. When sampling such data order does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for time series data, the observations are ordered by time and the observed values are **serially correlated**. For serially correlated data, the value of an observation will depend on one or more of the previous observations. Just a few of the many examples of data exhibiting serial correlation of the values include      \n",
    "- Temperature forecasts, where the future values are correlated with the current values. \n",
    "- The opening price of a stock is correlated with the price at the previous close. \n",
    "- The daily sales volume of a product is correlated with the previous sales volume. \n",
    "- A medical patient's blood pressure reading is correlated with the previous observations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the serial correlation common in time series data, we will need models which account for this behavior. In this lesson our focus will be on a class of models known as **autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) models**. These are linear models which account for the serial correlation in time series data.     \n",

    "2. Trend.   \n",
    "3. Seasonality.   \n",
    "4. Non-constant variance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that having a stationary series does not preclude the presence of serial correlations. Do not confuse these points! Many time series models focus on the serial correlation properties of time series but require stationarity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model for a time series process with white noise can be written:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "y_t &= \\phi y_{t-1} + w_t\\\\\n",
    "w_t &\\sim \\mathbb{N}(0,\\sigma)\n",

    "The above is an example of an **autoregressive model**, where the next value at the next time step depends on the current value. We will revisit these models in the next chapter.   \n",

    "The change from time $t-1$ to time $t$ can easly be worked out by taking the differences: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta y_t = (1- \\phi) y_{t-1} + w_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The foregoing equation has a root at $\\phi = 1$, known as the **unit root**. At the root the difference between the difference between $y_t$ and $y_{t-1}$ is just $w_t$, giving rise to a random walk, which is stochastic and **not stationary**:   \n",

    "This example gives us a way to create hypothesis tests for stationarity. We can test the hypothesis that there is a unit root to determine if a time series is stationary or not. However, there is another consideration we must deal with. There are, in fact, several ways to define a model for a stationary process:    \n",

There can be only a small difference between a time series with a unit root, which is non-stationary, and a time series with a root close to a unit, which is a stationary time series. As a result, unit root tests are said to **lack power**. This lack of power can have serious implications, since a hypothesis test may not be able to reject a hypothsis of non-stationary, when the time series in fact is, or in other cases, the oposite might be true. In practice, it is best to perform a visual inspection of the properties of the time series and well as perform unit root tests.   \n",

    "1. A commonly used test is the [**Augmented Dicky-Fuller test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) or **ADF** test. The ADF tests are unit root tests of the significance of a linear time series model. Coefficients represent components of the time series, such as trend and lagged differences, that make the series non-stationary. The **null distribution is that the series is non-stationary**.       \n",
