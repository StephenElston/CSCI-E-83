    "### What is a Markov process?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess from the name, a MCMC sampling uses a chain of **Markov sampling processes**. A Markov process is a **stochastic process** that a makes transition from a current state, $x_t$, to some next state, $x_{t+1}$, with some probability $\\Pi$. A Markov process has **no dependency on past states**. We can summarize properties of a Markov process:   \n",
    "- The probability of transition from one state to another is parameterized by a matrix of probabilities, $\\Pi$, of dim N X N for N possible state transitions,  \n",
    "- $\\Pi$  only depends on the current state, $x_t$,     \n",
    "- The transition can be to current state.   \n",

    "Notice that, since the Markov process is memoryless, the transition probability only depends on the current state, $x_t$. There is no dependency on any previous states, $\\{x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, \\ldots, x_0 \\}$. \n",

    "### From Markov process to Markov chain    \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only discussed a single step Markov process. That is, the process for a single state transition. What happens when there is a series of transitions? A sequence of such transitions is known as a **Markov chain**. There are two major behaviors observed with Markov Chains:  \n",
    "1. **Episodic Markov chains** have a **terminal state**. The terminal state can only transition to itself. Once the system is in the terminal state, we say that the episode has ended. Episodic processes are not of direct interest here, and we will not pursue them further.   \n",
    "2. **Continuous Markov chains** have no terminal state and continue indefinitely, at least in principle. Continuous Markov chains sample probability distribution, and are ideal for estimating Bayesian posterior distributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As already indicated, a Markov chain comprises a number of state transitions, one after another. Consider a chain of $n$ state transitions, $\\{t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_n \\}$. Each transition in this process has the probabilities given by the state transition matrix, $\\Pi$.            \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the probabilities of being in the states we use a special case known as a **stationary Markov chain**. We will not discuss the technical mathematical details here. Here we will just summarize the key result: Over a large number of time steps the number of times the states are visited is proportional to the state probabilities. Starting with some initial state, $\\vec{x}_0$, we can write the relationship as a continuous Markov chain:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Pi\\ \\Pi\\ \\Pi\\ \\ldots \\Pi\\ \\vec{x}_t = \\Pi^n\\ \\vec{x}_t  \\xrightarrow[\\text{$n \\rightarrow \\infty$}]{} \\vec{p(x)}$$    \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the above, we can find the probabilities of the states without ever actually knowing the values of the transition matrix, $\\Pi$. As long as we can repeatedly sample the stochastic Markov process, we can estimate the state probabilities. This is the key concept of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed with this lesson we will use stationary Markov chains to estimate posterior probabilities of Bayesian models. The method relies on the result that the state probabilities converge eventually. As a consequence, we can develop flexible methods for sampling posterior distributions using Markov chain Monte Carlo. In summary, the model is sampled using a Markov chain and the sampled distribution should converge to the posterior distribution.    "

    "\n",
    "Using the principle of Markov chains, a number of MCMC algorithms have been developed over time to sample posterior distributions of Bayesian models. The first MCMC sampling algorithm developed is the **Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm** (Metropolis et al. (1953), Hastings (1970)). This algorithm is often referred to as simply the Metropolis algorithm or the M-H algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The M-H algorithm has the following steps to estimate the posterior density of the parameters:\n",
    "1. Pick a starting point in the parameter space. This choice is typically a bit arbitrary. \n",
    "2. Evaluate the posterior distribution according to the model. In other words, take a sample of the likelihood $P(data|parameters)$ and prior, $P(parameters)$, and then compute the posterior.\n",
    "3. Choose a nearby point in parameter space randomly and evaluate the posterior at this point. The new point in parameter space is selected randomly, using a sampling distribution. The Normal distribution is a common choice of sampling distribution. Other distribution have also been used. \n",
    "4. Use the following **decision rule to accept or reject** the new sample:\n",
    "  - If the likelihood, $p(data | parameters)$, of the new point is greater than your current point, accept new point and move there.\n",
    "  - If the likelihood of the new point is less than your current point, only accept with probability according to the ratio:  \n",
    "$$Acceptance\\ probability\\ = \\frac{p(data | new\\ parameters)}{p(data | previous\\ parameters)}$$.\n",
    "4. If the sample is accepted, compute the posterior density at the new sample point.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, this algorithms converges and the posterior distribution is estimated. The M-H random sampling algorithm is far more **sample efficient** than naive grid sampling. To build some intuition, consider that since the M-H algorithm probabilistically samples the parameter space we only need to visit a limited number of points, rather than sample an entire grid. "

    "- If there is high **serial correlation** from one sample to the next in M-H chain converges slowly. In this case we say the Markov chain has low **sample efficiency**. \n",
    "- To ensure efficient convergence the algorithm must be ‘tuned’. The tuning involves finding a good dispersion parameter value for the state sampling distribution. This parameter determines the size of the jumps the algorithm makes in the parameter space. For example if we use Normal distribution we must pick the variance, $\\sigma^2$. If $\\sigma^2$ is too small, the chain will only search the space slowly, using small jumps. If $\\sigma^2$ is too big, there are large jumps which also slows convergence, since the sampling of high density regions will be less likely. "

    "### No U-Turn Sampler   \n",
    "\n",
    "The PyMC3 package uses the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm. NUTS uses an alternative to proposing new samples with the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criteria or exploring dimensions in a round-robin fashion as in done for the Gibbs sampler. Instead, NUTS models the exploration as the movement of a particle through a field. In 2-dimensions, this field can be imagined to look like a hilly landscape. The high spots on the hills are the high density regions we want to sample the most. The field that guides the movement of the particle through the space is derived from the target probability distribution, such that the particle is drawn towards dense (high likelihood) regions of the space. This strategy directs the exploration of the space using the gradient, rather than using a random wandering behavior as we saw with the M-H MCMC algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NUTS sampler is based on an earlier idea, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Imagine a ball in a 2-dimensional hilly landscape. The ball follows the gradient, which might send it part of the way up one of the hills. These hills represent the highest density regions of a distribution which we wish to sample. The difficulty with this idea is that one must set a number of time steps to simulate the motion of the ball. If the number of steps is too small, the algorithm will slow exploration of the parameter space. If the number of time steps is too large, the ball will jump around randomly. The original HMC method requires 2 hyperparameters to control stopping criteria of the ball. Unfortunately, in practice, setting these hyperparameters proved tricky, which limited the usefulness of HMC in practice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The NUTS sampler adds a simple heuristic to the HMC algorithm. The algorithm runs time both forward and backward. The point at which the forward and backward solutions meet, is the U-turn point. The number of time steps is set by finding this equilibrium point. The need for complex stopping criteria, and associated hyperparameters, is eliminated. As a result, NUTS is both a highly efficient sampler and easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why even discuss other samplers when we have the NUTS algorithm. Unfortunately, while NUTS works well in many common cases, it is not guaranteed to converge. For density functions with highly complex behavior, other samplers are required. In these cases, the Gibbs sampler is typically used.  "

    "\n",
    "Toward the end of the 19th Century there was growing public awareness of the rising accidental death rate in European coal mines. A mine disaster became defined as an incident leading to 6 or more deaths. As early as 1886 a British Royal Commission published recommendations for safety practices. However, adoption of these practices remained voluntary. The [British Coal Mines Act of 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Mines_Act_1911) finally codified mine safety procedures into law.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Famous data set originally published by Carlin, Gelfand, and Smith (1992) includes the number of coal mine disasters by year between 1851 and 1962. These data are available for download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabamitachakraborty/coal-mine-disastersuk), and other sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here is to create a model to quantify the differences in the rate of mine disasters before and after the introduction of improved safety practices. This analysis is an example of a **point process model**. A point process model has an **intensity** or **rate** of occurrence of a type of event, mine disasters in this case. The number events over a time period for this type of point process is independent and identically distributed (iid). In other words, the number of events per time period are a iid draw from some probability distribution. Because of the iid nature of the point process, there is no autoregressive (AR) effect in the time series.       \n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset gives us the rate of mine disasters by year so the problem can be addressed as a point process model. There are two related questions we can ask about these data. First, at what point in time was there a significant change in the rate or intensity of mine disasters, the switch point? The answer is not obvious from the history since the changes in safety practice were adopted over about 25 years. The second question is how significant was the reduction in the rate of disasters over this period?      \n",
    "\n",
    "As is common for point process models, we can try modeling the intensity of the point process using a Poisson distribution. If there is a switch point in time $s$, we can write the rate model for intensity of disasters at time t, $D_t$, as:\"     \n",
