There is another class of statistical models with a long and successful history, Bayesian models. In contrast to the frequentist approach, Bayesian models use **prior information** as well as data and likelihood model to perform inference.   \n",

        "Despite the long history, Bayesian models have not been used extensively until recently. This limited use is a result of several difficulties. The need to specify a **prior distribution** of known information has proved a formidable intellectual obstacle and is often cited as a reason for not using Bayesian methods. Further, modern Bayesian methods are often computationally intensive and have become practical only in the past few decades. Finally, the recent emergence of improved software and algorithms has resulted in wide and practical access to Bayesian methods.         \n",

The publication of his book set off a feud between Jefferys and Fisher which lasted until the death of both men in the 1970s. The feud resulted in Bayesian methods rarely being taught or used in scientific publications for many decades. Thus, the development and use of Bayesian models was limited in the mid 20th Century.   \n",

For example, the United States Coast Guard routinely uses a Bayesian model to find the most likely search locations for vessels in distress, given incomplete and vague reports of location. These methods made global headlines with the successful location of the missing Air France Flight 447. This aircraft had disappeared in little traveled area of the South Atlantic Ocean. Conventional location methods had failed to locate the wreckage, since the potential search area was quite large and the aircraft's emergency locater, or pinger, could not be detected. Bayesian methods were able to rapidly narrow the prospective search area, and the wreckage was successfully located. The Bayesian modeling methods used are discussed in a [paper by Stone et.al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4720.pdf) and summarized [here](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/bayesian-search-for-missing-aircraft-ships-and-people).

Confidence intervals are based on a **sampling distribution** of some statistic. Given this statistic, the upper and lower confidence intervals are the specified quantiles of the resulting parameter distribution. In Bayesian analysis there is no sampling distribution. Instead, we use a prior distribution along with a likelihood, computed from evidence, to compute a posterior distribution.    \n",

A credible interval is an interval on the Bayesian posterior distribution with the highest $\\alpha$ proportion of posterior probability. As an example, the $\\alpha = 0.90$ credible interval encompasses the 90% of the posterior distribution with the highest density. Alternatively, the credible interval is often referred to by other equivalent names; **highest density interval (HDI)**, the **highest posterior density interval (HPDI)**, or the **highest probability density (HPD)** interval.
