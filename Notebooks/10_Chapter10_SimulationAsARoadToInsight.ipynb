    "Monte Carlo simulation enables data scientists to study the behavior of stochastic processes with complex probability distributions. Simple processes might be approximated by a known, or 'named' distribution. In these simple cases, it might even be possible to derive analytical results. However, many real-world processes have complex behavior, resulting in complex distributions of output values. In these cases, simulation is a practical approach to understanding these processes. The two main purposes of simulation can be summarized as:       \n",
    "- **Testing models:** If data simulated from the model do not resemble the original observations, something is likely wrong with the model.     \n",
    "- **Understand processes with complex probability distributions:** In these cases, simulation provides a powerful and flexible computational technique to understand behavior.      \n",
    "\n",
    "As cheap computational power has become ubiquitous, simulation has become a widely used technique in the data scientist's toolbox. Simulations compute a large number of cases or realizations. The computing cost of each realization must be low in any practical simulation.   \n",

    "The realizations are drawn from complex probability distributions of the process being studied. In many cases, the realizations are computed using conditional probability distributions. The final or posterior distribution of the process being simulated is comprised of these realizations.     "

    "## The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation employs the key concepts; conditional probability distributions and sampling theory. In this chapter, you will perform a series of exercises to simulate the profitability of a sandwich shop. Not surprisingly, the sandwich shop earns money every time a customer buys a sandwich. However, the inputs to the sandwich cost money. The daily profit is the amount customers pay for the sandwiches minus the costs of the inputs.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of bread is an input which is particularly difficult to manage for this shop. The shop bakes its own bread before it opens, and the bread must be used on the day it is made. The customers can select one of three types of bread, white, wheat, and multigrain. The customers are unusually picky. If the shop does not have the bread of the customer's choice available, the customer will leave the shop without buying a sandwich. However, any extra bread left at the end of the day is discarded, and that cost reduces the profitability of the shop.     \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this simulation simple, several assumptions are made:     \n",
    "- The number of customers arriving at the shop each day is stationary with time and known to have a mean rate of 100 per day. Further, customers do not stop coming to the sandwich shop as a result of not finding their bread choice. In other words, the number of arrivals is independent of how many customers actually buy a sandwich.      \n",
    "- The probability that each customer chooses a particular type of bread is stationary and known. These probabilities are 50% for white bread, 25% for wheat, and 25% for multigrain.    \n",
    "- If a customer's choice of bread is not available the customer leaves the shop without buying a sandwich. We assume there are sufficient quantities of all other ingredients to keep things simple.     \n",
    "- If the customer buys a sandwich the mean profit to the shop is $1.00$, including the cost of the bread.    \n",
    "- The only perishable input which must be discarded at the end of each day is the bread. The discarded bread has a cost of $0.25$. To keep thing simple we are ignoring any other perishable ingrediants that may have to be discarded in a real-world sandwich shop.       \n",
    "- The manager of the shop must select a the number of breads baked with the goal of maximizing the profit of the shop. It is clear that the manager will select a mix of bread types of 50% for white bread, 25% for wheat, and 25% for multigrain. Any other choice is clearly not optimal, given the known probabilities of customer bread selection.   \n",
    "\n",
    "From this problem description, it is clear there is a trade-off between the profitability of the shop and the amount of bread baked. If the shop manager orders too little bread, opportunities for profitable sandwich sales are lost. On the other hand, over-production of bread leads to loss of profit from the waste.    \n",
    "\n",

    "But, there is still the issue of how much the results of this simulation vary from run to run. This means, there is considerable uncertainty or variability in the daily profit. Running a simulation multiple times yields the **posterior distribution** of the variables being simulated. In this case we are interested in the posterior distribution of the profitability vs. the number of breads baked. "

    "The foregoing simulation has given some insight into the relationship between bread baked and the profitability of the sandwich shop. But of course, the real world is much more complicated. Some examples of real-world complexity that could be accounted for in a more complete simulation include:      \n",
    "- The arrival rate of customers may change with the day of the week or the season of the year.   \n",
    "- Other inventory items, besides bread, that are also perishable and have costs.    \n",
    "- The labor costs for the shop can be variable depending on a finer grain time scale. For example, if most customers arrive within a short window of time more employees are required to meet the surge in demand.     "
