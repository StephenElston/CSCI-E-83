To further complicate the problem there are several commonly used forms of deviance. Here we will focus on one the simplest and easiest to understand forms, known as **null deviance**. Null deviance is 2 times the square of the log odds ratio between a model and a null model. Intuitively, the null model is simply informed guessing, and deviance is a measure of how much the model improves accuracy beyond guessing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The deviance statistic is $\\chi^2$ distributed, and we can apply a significance test on a model.A model with small deviance is little better that informed guessing, and will have a small $\\chi^2$ and not be considered a significant improvement. Whereas, a model with large deviance has a large $\\chi^2$, demonstrating a significant improvement in accuracy.     \n",

In other words, the null model is no better in terms of predictive power than just saying that all values of $y$ are either 0 or all values are 1.    \n",
