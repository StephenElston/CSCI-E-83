## Why Are Time Series Useful?

- Data are often time-ordered 
- Estimates 30% of data science problems include time series data
- Must use specific time series models


## Why Are Time Series Useful?


<center> "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future!"</center>    

<center>Karl Kristian Steincke, Danish politician, ca 1937</center>   

- **Demand forecasting:** Electricity production, Internet bandwidth, Traffic management, Inventory management, sales forecasting     
- **Medicine:** Time dependent treatment effects, EKG, EEG    
- **Engineering and Science:** Signal analysis, Analysis of physical processes   
- **Capital markets and economics:** Seasonal unemployment, Price/return series, Risk analysis 


## Why Are Time Series Data Different? 

Models must account for time series behavior      

- Most statistical and machine learning assume data samples are **independent identically distributed (iid)**             

- But, this is not the case for time series data       

- Time series values are correlated in time       

- Time series data exhibit **Serial correlation**      
   * Serial correlation of values      
   * Serial correlation of errors     
   * Violate iid assumptions of many statistical and ML Models    
`


## Why Are Time Series Data Different


Examples of series correlation:      

- Temperature forecasts, where the future values are correlated with the current values     
-  The opening price of a stock is correlated with the price at the previous close    
- The daily sales volume of a product is correlated with the previous sales volume     
- A medical patient's blood pressure reading is correlated with the previous observations    



## History of Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis have a long history   
- Recognized the serial dependency in time series data early on     
- Joseph Fourier and Siemon Poisson worked on time series problems in the early 19th Century    

```{r Fourier, out.width = '20%', fig.cap='Joseph Fourier', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/Fourier.jpg"))
``` 



## History of Time Series Analysis

Modern history of time series analysis started with George Udny Yule (1927) and Gilbert Walker (1931)   

- Yule worked on sunspot time series    
- Walker was attempting to forecast the tropical monsoon cycle   
- Developed the **autoregressive (AR)** model to account for serial correlation of values      
- The AR model is foundation of modern time series models

knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/George_Udny_Yule.jpg"))
``` 


## History of Time Series Analysis

Mathematical prodigy, Norbert Weiner, invented filters for stochastic time series processes, starting in the 1920s

- Weiner's filter theory is the basis of many time series filter methods
- Predictive filters for noisy signals; not discussed here
- Weiner process model for random walks is widely used

```{r Norbert_wiener, out.width = '20%', fig.cap='Norbert Weiner: Invented time series filters', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/Norbert_wiener.jpg"))
``` 

## History of Time Series Analysis

George Box and Gwilym Jenkins fully developed a statistical theory of time series by extending the work of Yule and Walker in the 1950s and 1960s    

- Extended the AR model to include **moving average (MA)** terms     
- Included the **integrative term** to create the **ARIMA** model     
- The ARIMA model is our focus

## Fundamentals of Time Series   

What are the fundamental properties of time series  

- Representation and sampling   
- White noise series    
- Stationary time series    
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation    
- Random walk series    
- Trend      
- Seasonal effects    



## Time Series Representation

Time series are expressed as a time ordered sequence of values $(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n)$    

- We work with **discrete samples** in time order   
- In **regular time series** the sample interval $\Delta t$ is fixed   
- Time measured from start of series $(0, \Delta t, 2 \Delta t, \ldots,n \Delta t)$   
- Or, time measured within an **interval**, multiples of $\Delta t$        
- Even continuous time processes are sampled in practice   
  - Temperature    
  - Pressure   
  - Home price  


## White Noise Series   

**White noise series** are fundamental     

- Values are **independent identically distributed (iid)**, Normmal 
- Can express values, $(w_1, w_2, w_3, \ldots, w_n)$, of a white noise series as:   

$$X(t) = (w_1, w_2, w_3, \ldots, w_n)\\
where\\
w_t \sim \mathbb{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$

- No serial correlation between values   
  * There is no predictive information in a white noise series   
  * We want the **residuals** of time series models to be white noise series   


## White Noise Series

plot_ts(white, 'white noise')
```


## White Noise Series  

What does a white noise series look like?  

- Each value is a sample is iid Normally distributed   
- No trend   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
def dist_ts(ts, lab = '', bins = 40):
    ## Setup a figure with two subplots side by side
    f, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))
    ## Plot the histogram with labels
    ts.hist(ax = ax1, bins = bins, alpha = 0.5)
    ax1.set_xlabel('Value')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Frequency')
    ax1.set_title('Histogram of ' + lab)
    ## Plot the q-q plot on the other axes
    ss.probplot(ts, plot = ax2)
    plt.show()
    
dist_ts(white, 'white noise')    
```


## Introduction to Stationary Time Series   

A white noise series is **stationary**    

- A stationary time series has statistical properties constant in time   
- For example, a stationary time series has **constant mean and variance** over any sample interval    
- Many time series models require stationarity        
  * Often transform time series to make them stationary    
  * More on this later     


## Stationary Time Series    

What tests can be used for stationarity?    

- Plots    
  * Qualitative      
  * Nonstationarity from seasonality and trend are usually visible     
- Hypothesis tests    



## Autocorrelation Properties of White Noise Series

Can measure the correlation of a time series with itself    

- The time series is correlated at different time offsets     

- Each time step of offset is called a **lag**   

- The **autocorrelation function (ACF)** is measured between the series and the series lagged in time        


## Autocorrelation Properties of White Noise Series    

We compute the autocorrelation at lag $k$:  

$$\rho_k = \frac{\gamma_k}{n \sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n \sigma^2} \sum_{t = 1}^N (y_{t} - \mu) \cdot (y_{t-k} - \mu)$$    
Where:    
\begin{align}
k &= lag\\
y_t &= observaton\ at\ time\ t\\
\gamma_k &= covariance\ lag\ k\\
\mu &= mean\ of\ the\ series\\ 
\sigma^2 &= variance\ of\ the\ series = \frac{1}{n-1}\Sigma_{t = 1}^N (y_{t} - \mu) \cdot (y_{t} - \mu)
\end{align}


- Notice that for any series, $\rho_0 = 1$   
- Autocorrelation at each lag has values in the range $-1.0 \ge \rho \ge 1.0$   


## Autocorrelation Properties of White Noise Series

The **partial autocorrelation** is another important property of time series  

- The **partial autocorrelation function (PACF)** is the residual autocorrelation once autocorrelation is accounted for   
- To compute the partial autocorrelation to lag $k$:   
  * Compute the autocorrelation to lag $k$   
  * Remove the linearly predictable autocorrelation component of the time series    
  * Compute the (partial) autocorrelation of the residual to lag $k$   
- The 0 lag value of the partial autocorrelation is always 1.0   

## Autocorrelation Properties of White Noise Series   

What are the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation properties of a white noise series?   

- The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation are 0 for all $k \gt 0$   
- Autocorrelation plot shows value at each lag selected   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
def acf_pacf_plot(ts):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(12,3))
    _=splt.plot_acf(ts, lags = 40, ax=ax[0])
    _=splt.plot_pacf(ts, lags = 40, method='yw', ax=ax[1])
    plt.show()

acf_pacf_plot(white)
```


## Hypothesis Test of Autocorrelation    

The [Ljung-Box Q statistic](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.diagnostic.acorr_ljungbox.html#statsmodels.stats.diagnostic.acorr_ljungbox) used to test for autocorrelation   

- Q is close to $\chi^2$ distributed     

- Q computed from autocorrelation of at multiple lag values, $\rho_i$    

$$Q = n(n+2) \sum_{k=1}^h \frac{\hat{\rho}^2_k}{n-k}$$

- Null hypothesis is that there is no serial correlation between iid values $\rightarrow$ large p-value    

- Alternative hypothesis is serial correlation gives high values of Q statistic $\rightarrow$ small p-value




## Random Walk Time Series  

Random walks are a commonly encountered properties of time series    

- Change in value of random walk series at one time step:    
$$w_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$$   

- The next value in the random walk is then:   
$$y_t = y_{t-1} + w_t$$  

Or, with a little bit of algebra:    

$$y_t = w_t + \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} w_i$$


## Random Walk Time Series  

Random walk is the sum of innovations:     

$$y_t = w_t + \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} w_i$$   

- $w_i =$ the $i^{th}$ **innovation**    
- $y_t=$ observation at time $t$      
- A random walk is an **integrative process**; sum or integral of innovations     

*Note:* innovations are referred to by other names:    
- **Shocks** in the stochastic process literature    
- **Returns** in financial analytics     


## Random Walk Time Series   

What does a random walk time series look like?    

- Integrating innovations leads to 'drift' behavior   
- No actual trend; but can be considerable **drift**   
- Random walk will eventually change apparent slope    

Example with iid Normal innovations:

```{python, echo=FALSE}
nr.seed(3344)
def ran_walk(start = '1-1990', end = '1-2015', freq = 'M', sd = 1.0, mean = 0):
    dates = pd.date_range(start = start, end = end, freq = freq)
    walk = pd.Series(nr.normal(loc = mean, scale = sd, size = len(dates)),
                    index = dates)
    return(walk.cumsum())
walk = ran_walk()   
plot_ts(walk, 'random walk')
```

## Random Walk Time Series    

- Autocorrelation of random walk series dies slowly     
- Partial autocorrelation $=1$ at lag one   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
acf_pacf_plot(walk)
```


## Random Walk Time Series  

Random walk series is not Normally distributed, even if innovations are  

```{python, echo=FALSE}
dist_ts(walk, 'random walk')    
```

## Random Walk Time Series   

Random walk time series are **non-stationary**     

- Consider the **covariance** of a time series at lag $k$:    

$$\gamma_k = Cov(y_t, y_{t+k})$$ 

- For a random walk, the increase in covariance is **unbounded in time**:   
$$\gamma_k = Cov(y_t, y_{t+k}) = k \sigma^2 \rightarrow \infty\ as\ k \rightarrow \infty$$

- Unbounded and time dependent variance make a **random walk non-stationary**     


## Time Series With Trend   

Many real-world time series have a long-term **trend**    

- A trend is a long term change in the mean value of the time series    
- Typically model trend as linear, polynomial, non-parametric splines, etc.   
- Consider an example of a white noise series with a linear trend    

```{python, echo=FALSE}
nr.seed(6677)
def trend(start = '1-1990', end = '1-2015', freq = 'M', slope = 0.02, sd = 0.5, mean = 0):
    dates = pd.date_range(start = start, end = end, freq = freq)
    trend = pd.Series([slope*x for x in range(len(dates))],
                    index = dates)
    trend = trend + nr.normal(loc = mean, scale = sd, size = len(dates))
    return(trend)
                              
trends = trend()   
plot_ts(trends, 'white noise with trend')
```

## Time Series With Trend

Trend models are not just strait lines      

- Polynomial regression     

- Piece-wise polynomial regression - e.g. splines    
  * Used in [PROFIT algorithm](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2017/2/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/)       
  * A **generalized additive model**

- [Local polynomial regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) - e.g. LOESS  
  * Used in Statsmodels    



## Time Series With Trend

Time series with trend are non-stationary   

- Any time series with trend is non-stationary     
  * Mean and variance are dependent of window used to compute them     
- The distribution of even a white noise series with trend is non-Normal   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
dist_ts(trends, lab = '\n trend + white noise')
```

## Time Series With Trend

ACF and PACF are only properly defined for stationary series    

- For non-stationary series, the ACF dies off slowly   
   * Integrating innovations leads to **long-term dependency**    

- The PACF dies off quickly with lag   

- Example: ACF and PACF of the white noise series with trend   


```{python, echo=FALSE}
acf_pacf_plot(trends)
```


## Time Series With Seasonal Effects

Many (most?) real-world time series have **seasonal effect**    

- A seasonal effect has a measurable effect that occurs periodically    
- Examples of seasonal events include:    
  * Day of the week    
  * Last day of the month   
  * Month of the year   
  * Annual holiday   
  * Option expiration date   
  * Game day, e.g. Supper Bowl   
  * Electrical impulses in a heart - EKG      
  * Orbits of planets     
  * $\ldots$    
- Time series with seasonal effects are non-stationary   
  * Mean and variance depends of sample window    

## Time Series With Seasonal Effects  

Use regression models for seasonal effects   

- Simple regression model:  
   * Coefficient for each interval in period; e.g. 12 coefficients for monthly effects     
      * But simple approach leads to high variance estimates of coefficients for periodic behavior  
   * Coefficient for specific effect - e.g. date of holiday   
   * Good option for specific date behavior    

- Basis function regression    
   * [PROFIT algorithm](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2017/2/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/) uses Fourier basis functions     
  * A **generalized additive model**   
  
- Take **seasonal differences**    


## Time Series With Seasonal Effects    

Example of a time series with a seasonal effect    

- A white noise series with trend and seasonal behavior   
- The seasonal behavior is periodic   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
nr.seed(5544)
def seasonal_ts(start = '1-1990', end = '1-2015', freq = 'M', slope = 0.02, sd = 0.5, mean = 0):
    dates = pd.date_range(start = start, end = end, freq = freq)
    seasonal = pd.Series([slope*x for x in range(len(dates))],
                    index = dates)
    seasonal = seasonal + nr.normal(loc = mean, scale = sd, size = len(dates))
    seasonal = seasonal + [2.0*sin(pi*x/6) for x in range(len(dates))] + 5.0
    return(seasonal)

seasonal = seasonal_ts()
plot_ts(seasonal, 'seasonal data')
```  


## Time Series Decomposition    

Simple model for seasonal effects    

- Goal, decompose the time series into its components    
- The [**Seasonal Trend decomonsition model using Loess (STL)**](https://otexts.com/fpp2/stl.html) model   
  * Uses a nonparametric and nonlinear local regression model, LOESS, to decompose trend component    
  * Components are **seasonal (S)**, **trend (T)**, and the **residual (R)**  
  * Additive decomposition model    
  * Multiplicative decomposition model  
  * MSTL adds modeling of multiple seasonal components   
- Differencing model   


## Time Series Decomposition

The **additive decomposition model** is expressed as as the sum of the components:   

$$TS(t) = S(t) + T(t) + R(t)$$     

- Used when seasonal effect is constant in time   
- Examples: Physical process   


## Time Series Decomposition   

The **Multiplicative decomposition model** is expressed as as the product of the components:   

$$TS(t) = S(t) * T(t) * R(t)$$     

- The multiplicative form is can be hard to work with, so log transform to additive model    

\begin{align} 
log(TS(t)) &= log(S(t)) + log(T(t)) + log(R(t))\\  
&= S^l(t) + T^l(t) + R^l(t)  
\end{align}

- Use when seasonal effect changes in time     
- Example, economic time series    


## Time Series Decomposition

Example of addative STL decomposition of time series with linear trend and seasonal effect   

- The original series plot is on top   
- Notice the estimated trend is not a straight line; a result of noise    
- Residuals are relatively small and **homoscedastic**, e.g. stationary       


```{python, echo=FALSE}
def decomp_ts(ts, freq = 'M', model = 'additive'):
    res = sts.seasonal_decompose(ts, model=model, period=12) 
    res.plot()
    plt.show()
    return(pd.DataFrame({'resid': res.resid, 
                         'trend': res.trend, 
                         'seasonal': res.seasonal},
                       index = ts.index) )

decomp = decomp_ts(seasonal) 
```


## Time Series Difference Operators   

Is there an alternative for dealing with trend?    

How do we deal with random walks?     

- Both random walks and trends are **integrative processes**  
- **Difference operators** are useful for both cases    
- Difference operators return the innovations   

$$\nabla y_t = y_t - y_{t-\delta}$$
Where $\delta =$ the time difference    



## Time Series Difference Operators   

Difference operators return the innovations   

$$\nabla y_t = y_t - y_{t-\delta}$$

- Difference operators can be of any order in principle    
   * Typically use first order differences    

- Differences can be non-seasonal or seasonal   
   * Non-seasonal first order difference; $\delta = 1$
   * Seasonal first order difference; $\delta + p$; $p =$ period of seasonality 

- Difference operator of span size $\delta$ computes a series $\delta$ shorter than original     


## Time Series Difference Operators   

Example of a first order difference operator applied to random walk    

- The innovations look random    
- Need to verify statistical properties    


```{python, echo=FALSE}
walk_diffs = walk.diff()[1:]
_=plot_ts(walk_diffs, 'Differences of random walk')
plt.show()
```


## Time Series Difference Operators    

Statistical properties of the difference series       

- Compute the ACF and PACF    
- The plots indicate the difference series is white noise    


```{python, echo=FALSE}
acf_pacf_plot(walk_diffs)
dist_ts(walk_diffs, 'difference of random walk')
```




## Stationarity       

A **Stationary time series has statistical properties that are invariant in time**     

Conversely, a time series is not stationary if it has any of the following properties:     
1. Random walk.    
2. Trend.   
3. Seasonality.   
4. Non-constant variance.   

Note, a stationary series does not preclude the presence of serial correlations     
- Do not confuse these points!    
- Many time series models for serial correlation properties require stationarity   


## Stationarity    

A simple model for a time series process with white noise can be written:   

\begin{align}
y_t &= \phi y_{t-1} + w_t\\
w_t &\sim \mathbb{N}(0,\sigma)
\end{align}

- Example of an **autoregressive model**, where thevalue at the next time step depends on the current value  

- The change from time $t-1$ to time $t$ can easily be worked out by taking the differences:   

$$\Delta y_t = (1- \phi) y_{t-1} + w_t$$


## Stationarity    

The change from time $t-1$ to time $t$ can easily be worked out by taking the differences:   

$$\Delta y_t = (1- \phi) y_{t-1} + w_t$$

- Foregoing has a root at $\phi = 1$, know as the **unit root**   

- At the root the difference between $y_t$ and $y_{t-1}$ is just $w_t$      

- Gives rise to a random walk, which is stochastic and **not stationary**:   

$$y_t = \sum_{i=0}^t w_i$$ 



## Stationarity    

A random walk is stochastic and **not stationary**:   

$$y_t = \sum_{i=0}^t w_i$$ 

- Provides a basis for hypothesis tests of stationarity     

- Test the hypothesis that there is a unit root to determine is a time series is stationary    



## Stationarity    

There are several ways to define a model for a stationary process:    

1. A **unit root test** as discussed

$$y_t = \phi y_{t-1} + w_t$$

2. A **unit root test with a constant**     
    - Often constant is initial value, $c=y_0$     
    - Or a mean value 

$$y_t = c + \phi y_{t-1} + w_t$$

3. **Trend stationary process**, with or without a constant     
    - Used to test if a process is **stationary about a deterministic trend**, $\beta$. 

$$y_t = c + \beta t + \phi y_{t-1} + w_t$$



## Stationarity  

There are a number of ways to determine if a time series is stationary. 

We will work with two of the many possible tests here:            

1. [**Augmented Dicky-Fuller test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) or **ADF** test     
    - ADF tests are unit root tests of the significance a linear time series model   
    - Coefficients represent components of the time series, e.g. trend and lagged differences   
    - Null distribution is that the series is non-stationary       

2. [**Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPSS_test) is a unit root test for stationarity about a trend of time series    
    - Null hypothesis is that the time series is trend stationary    


## Stationarity  

There is often a small difference between a time series with a unit root, which is non-stationary, and a time series with a root close to unit     

- Therefore, unit root tests are said to **lack power**    
- Lack of power means a hypothesis test may not be able to reject a hypothesis of non-stationary    
- In other cases, the opposite might be true    
- It is best to perform a visual inspection of the properties of the time series as well
