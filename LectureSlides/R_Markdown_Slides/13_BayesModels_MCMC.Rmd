## Review       

Bayesian analysis is a contrast to frequentist methods          

-	The objective of Bayesian analysis is to compute a **posterior distribution**   
   - Contrasts with frequentist statistics with objective to compute a **point estimate** and **confidence interval** from a sample      


-	Bayesian models allow expressing **prior information** as a **prior distribution**    

-	The posterior distribution is said to quantify our current **belief**    
    - Belief is based on the posterior distribution   
    - We update beliefs based on additional data or evidence    
    - A critical difference with frequentist models which must be computed from a complete sample   
   
-	Inference can be performed on the posterior distribution by finding the maximum a postiori (MAP) value and a credible interval    

- Predictions are made by simulating from the posterior distribution  


## Review      

Two functions must be defined to compute the posterior distribution     

- The **likelihood** for the model being used     
  - The likelihood function includes the parameters for the model      
  - Example; for Binomial likelihood is the probability of success    
  - Example; for Normal likelihood is the mean, $\mu$ and variance. $\sigma^2$      

- The **prior distribution** encodes the information we have in advance about the model parameters    
   - Simple cases use a **conjugate distribution** of the likelihood     
   - The posterior distribution is in the conjugate family    
   - Example, for binomial likelihood, the conjugate is the Beta$(\alpha,\beta)$     
   - Example, for Normal likelihood, the normal distribution is the conjugate for the mean, $\mu$     



## Introduction       

How can we extend Bayes models to more complex problems?     

- For simple problems we can use a conjugate prior and posterior             

- What about problems with complex likelihood?   

- Need to perform sampling to compute approximation of posterior    

- Highly efficient sampling methods required for complex problems   

## Grid Sampling Cannot Scale!       

Real-world Bayes models have large numbers of parameters, into the millions    

- Naive approach is simple grid sampling     
   - Sample across dimensions of the parameter space       

- Consider this thought experiment, sampling dimension 100 times:     
   - 1-parameter model: $100$ samples    
   - 2-parameter model: $100^2 = 10000$ samples    
   - 3-parameter model: $100^3 = 10^5$ samples
   - 100-parameter model: $100^{100} = 10^{102}$ samples  

- Computational complexity of grid sampling has **exponential scaling** with dimensionality   

- Need a better approach! 

## Scaling Bayesian models

How can we scale Bayesian models to 1000s of parameters?   

- **Variational methods**     
   * Based on variational calculus    
   * A very effective and highly scaleable method         
   * But, mathematically difficult to apply as a general solution       
   * Details beyond our scope      

- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**      
   * A simple and reliable method for Bayesian inference   
   * Trade-off variance of estimates and computer power for ease of implementation
   * Our focus in this course    

## Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Large-scale Bayesian models need highly efficient sampling methods     

- **Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling** is efficient and scalable    

- Rather than sampling on a grid, MCMC methods sample distributions efficiently   
   * Sample higher density regions of posterior with higher probability    

- Requires effort to understand how the algorithm works   
   * What to do when things go wrong     


## What is a Markov process?

MCMC sampling uses a **Markov processes sampling chain**     

- $X_t$ is the **state vector** of **state probabilities** for $N$ possible states  
   
   $$X_t = [x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_N]$$

- A Markov process is a **stochastic process** that transitions from a current state probabilities, $X_t$, to some next state probabilities, $X_{t+1}$, with probability $\Pi$      
   - **No dependency on past states**     
   
 
   
- Key properties of a Markov process:    
   - Probability of state transition is parameterized by a matrix of probabilities, $\Pi$, of dim N X N for N possible states    
   - $\Pi$  only depends on the current state, $X_t$    
   - Transition can be to current state.   


## What is a Markov process?

Since Markov transition process depends only on the current state a Markov process is **memoryless**    

- We can express the sequence of a Markov transition processes as:

$$p(X_{t + 1}| X_t, X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, \ldots, X_0) = p(X_{t + 1}| X_t)$$


- The Markov process is **memoryless**   
   - Transition probability only depends on the current state, $X_t$     
   - No dependency on any previous states, $X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, \ldots, X_0$. 


## What is a Markov process?

For system with $N$ possible states we can write the **transition probability matrix**, $\Pi$:

\begin{align}
\Pi &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\pi_{1,1} & \pi_{1,2} & \cdots & \pi_{1, N}\\
\pi_{2,1} & \pi_{2,2} & \cdots & \pi_{2,N}\\
\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\
\pi_{N,i} & \pi_{N,2} & \cdots & \pi_{N,N}
\end{bmatrix}\\
&where\\
\pi_{i,j} &= probability\ of\ transition\ state\ x_j\ to\ state\ x_i\\
&and\\
\pi_{i,i} &= probability\ of\ staying\ in\ state\ x_i\\
&further\\
\pi_{i,j} &\ne \pi_{j,i}\ in\ general
\end{align}




## Example of a Markov Process

To make the foregoing more concrete let's construct a simple example. We will start with a system of 3 states, $\{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \}$. The transition matrix is:    

$$\Pi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\pi_{1,1} & \pi_{1,2} & \pi_{1,3}\\
\pi_{2,1} & \pi_{2,2} & \pi_{2,3}\\
\pi_{3,1} & \pi_{3,2} & \pi_{3,3}
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0.0 & 0.6\\
0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4\\
0.3 & 0.7 & 0.0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Some key points to notice    
   - The probabilities of transition from a state is given in a column     
   - The probabilities in each column must add to 1.0    
   - The probabilities of a transition to the same state are along the diagonal of the matrix    

- Some transitions not possible have a probability of 0.0    
   - Example, $\pi_{2,1} = 0$; cannot transition from state 2 to 1 
   - Example, $\pi_{3,3} = 0$; cannot remain in state 3


## Example of a Markov Process

Let's apply a probability matrix to a set of possible states      

- The **state vector** represents being in the first state at time step $t$; $\vec{X}_t = [1,0,0]$   
- After a state transition, we compute the probability of being in each of the three possible states at the next time step, $t+1$:  

$$\vec{X}_{t+1}  = \Pi\ \vec{X}_t = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0.0 & 0.6\\
0.2 & 0.3 & 0.4\\
0.3 & 0.7 & 0.0
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
0\\
0
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 \\
0.2 \\
0.3 
\end{bmatrix} 
$$


## From Markov process to Markov chain    

The foregoing is a single step of a Markov process      

- What happens when there is a series of transitions?     

- A sequence of such transitions is known as a **Markov chain**      

- There are two classes of Markov Chains       

- **Episodic Markov chains** have a **terminal state**      
   - The terminal state can only transition to itself     
   - Once the system is in the terminal state, we say that the episode has ended      
   - Episodic processes are not of direct interest here      

- **Continuous Markov chains** have no terminal state    
   - Continue indefinitely, at least in principle    
   - Continuous Markov chains sample probability distribution     
   - Are ideal for estimating Bayesian posterior distributions  


## From Markov process to Markov chain    

Markov chain comprises a number of state transitions      

- Chain of $n$ state transitions, $\{t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots, t_n \}$     

- Each transition has the probabilities given by the state transition matrix, $\Pi$               

- To estimate the probabilities of being in the states we use a special case known as a **stationary Markov chain**  
   - We will skip the technical mathematical details here     
   - Over a large number of time steps the number of times the states are visited is proportional to the state probabilities    


## From Markov process to Markov chain    

Start with initial state, $\vec{x}_0$ for a continuous Markov chain:   

$$\Pi\ \Pi\ \Pi\ \ldots \Pi\ \vec{X}_t = \Pi^n\ \vec{X}_t  \xrightarrow[\text{$n \rightarrow \infty$}]{} p(\vec{X})$$    

- We can find the probabilities of the states without knowing the values of the transition matrix, $\Pi$!    

- As long as we can repeatedly sample the stochastic Markov process, we can estimate the state probabilities     

- This is the key to Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling! 


## MCMC and the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

The first MCMC sampling algorithm developed is the **Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm**; often referred to as Metropolis algorithm or the M-H algorithm. 

- The M-H algorithm uses the following steps to estimate the posterior density:    
1. Pick a starting point in the parameter space       
2. Choose a nearby point in parameter space randomly from a **sampling distribution**   
3. Evaluate the posterior at this point   
   - Product of the likelihood $P(data|parameters)$ and prior, $P(parameters)$     
4. Use the following **decision rule to accept or reject** the new sample:

5. If the sample is accepted, compute the posterior density at the new sample point    

6. Repeat steps, 2, 3, 4 and 5, many times, until convergence      



## MCMC and the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

M-H algorithm uses the following **decision rule to accept or reject** the new sample:

- If the likelihood, $p(data | parameters)$, of the new point is greater than the current point, accept new point  

- If the likelihood of the new point is less than the current point, accept with probability according to the ratio: 

$$Acceptance\ probability\ = \frac{p(data | new\ parameters)}{p(data | previous\ parameters)}$$



## MCMC and the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

*Eventually*, the M-H algorithms converges to the posterior distribution    

- M-H random sampling algorithm is far more **sample efficient** than naive grid sampling      

- Consider that the M-H algorithm probabilistically samples the parameter space      
   - Preferentially sample high density areas    
   - Not every point on a grid     

- Important properties of the  Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm include:     
   - The M-H algorithm is **guaranteed to eventually converge** to the underlying distribution, but convergence can be quite slow     
   - High **serial correlation** from one sample to the next in chain gives slow convergence 

## MCMC and the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

Poor convergence arises from low **sample efficiency**      

- Algorithm must be ‘tuned’ to ensure sample efficiency    

- Tuning finds a good dispersion parameter value for the state sampling distribution    

- Dispersion parameter determines the size of the jumps the algorithm makes    

- Example, for Normal sampling distribution pick the variance $\sigma^2$     
   - $\sigma^2$ is too small, the chain only slowly searches     
   - $\sigma^2$ is too big, chain has are large jumps which  slows convergence    

## M-H algorithm example

Let's try a simple example, find an estimate of the posterior density of a bivariate Normal distribution     

$$\mu = \begin{bmatrix} .5\\ .5 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$Covariance = \begin{bmatrix} 1, .6\\ .6, 1 \end{bmatrix}$$


```{r BivariateNormalSamples, out.width = '30%', fig.cap='Random samples from a bivariate Normal distribution', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/BivariateNormalSamples.png"))
```


## M-H algorithm example

And, the marginal distributions of the variables  

```{r BivariateNormalMarginal, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='Marginal distributions of bivariate Normal samples', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/BivariateNormalMarginal.png"))
```


## M-H algorithm example

Now, we are ready to sample these data using the M-H MCMC algorithm    

The algorithm is

1. Compute the bi-variate Normal distribution likelihood 
2. Initialize the chain
3. Initialize some hyperparameters statistics
4. Sample the likelihood of the data using the M-H algorithm.

```{r MCMC_SamplesBivariateNormal, out.width = '40%', fig.cap='MCMC samples from bivariate Normal distribution', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MCMC_SamplesBivariateNormal.png"))
```

## M-H algorithm example   

Plot the first 500 samples     


```{r MCMC_500SamplesBivariateNormal, out.width = '40%', fig.cap='MCMC samples from bivariate Normal distribution', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MCMC_500SamplesBivariateNormal.png"))
```

Notice the long 'tail' on the sampled distribution from the **burn-in period**.


## M-H algorithm example   

Marginal distributions of the MCMC samples, less first 500

```{r MCMC_MarginalBivariateNormal, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='First 500 MCMC samples from bivariate Normal distribution', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MCMC_MarginalBivariateNormal.png"))
```

These marginals are similar to the original distribution  


## Convergence and sampling efficiency of MCMC

How can we understand the onvergence properties of the M-H MCMC sampler     

- MCMC sampling generally convergences to the underlying distribution, but can be slow    

- In some pathological cases, convergence may not occur at all  

- The **acceptance rate** and **rejection rate** are key convergence statistics for the M-H algorithm     
   - Low acceptnce or high rejection rate are signs of poor convergence    
   - Too few rejections, indicate that the algorithm is not exploring the parameter space sufficiently   
   - Trade-off between these statistics is controlled by the dispersion of the sampling distribution    
   - Unfortunately, there are few useful rules of thumb one can use     
   
For our example these statistics are fairly good:    

$$Acceptance\ rate = 0.81$$
$$Rejection\ rate = 0.19$$


## Evaluation of MCMC sampling   

**Trace** plot of the samples displays the sample value of the parameter with sample number

```{r MH_Traces, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='Trace plots for two variables from the M-H algorithm', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MH_Traces.png"))
```

The traces show sampling around the highest density values of the parameters, indicating good convergence   

## Evaluation of MCMC sampling 

An autocorrelation plot shows how a sample value is related to the previous samples   

- The autocorrelation of the Markov chain sampling    

```{r MH_Autocorr, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='Autocorrelation of Markov chain for the two parameters', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MH_Autocorr.png"))
```
- Notice that the autocorrelation dies off fairly quickly with lag   

- Low auto correlation indicates good sampling efficiency   

## Evaluation of MCMC sampling 

We can relate sampling efficiency to the autocorrelation of the samples      

- Intuitively, uncorrelated samples provide maximum information on the distribution sampled       
   - With significant autocorrelation, the new information gathered per-sample is reduced     
   
- **Effective sample size or ESS**.is the ratio between the number of samples adjusted for the autocorrelation and the hypothetical number of uncorrelated samples, N

$$ESS = \frac{N}{1 + 2 \sum_k ACF(k)}$$    

- ESS close to N indicates low autocorrelation and high sample efficiency   

## Other MCMC Sampling Algorithms

A number of other powerful MCMC sampling algorithms have been developed     

- The M-H can suffer from slow convergence for several reasons    
   - Generally has fairly high serial correlation and low ESS      
   - Must ‘tune’ the state selection probability distribution     

- As a result of these limitations, other MCMC sampling methods have been proposed in a quest to improve sample efficiency including:    
   - Gibbs sampling     
   - No U turn sampling (NUTS)     


## Gibbs sampling

Gibbs sampler is an improved MCMC sampler which speeds convergence   

- Named for the 19th Century physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs; inspired by statistical mechanics        
- Gibbs sampler samples each dimension of the parameter space sequentially in a round-robin manner    
- M-H algorithm attempts jumps across all dimensions of the parameter space. 

- Compared to the M-H, Gibbs sampling reduces serial correlation through round-robin sampling    

- Update along each dimension approximately orthogonal to the preceding sampled dimension    

- There are no tuning parameters since sampling is based on the marginals of the likelihood.

## Gibbs sampling  

The basic Gibbs sampler algorithm has the following steps:

1. For an N dimensional parameter space, $\{ \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_N \}$, find a random starting point  

2. In order, $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, N\}$, assign the next dimension to sample, starting with dimension $1$; actual order not important     

3. Sample the marginal distribution of the parameter given the observations, $D$, and other parameter values: $p(\theta_1|D, \theta_2, \theta_3, \ldots, \theta_N)$     

3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence   



## Hamiltonian MCMC   

The Hamiltonian sampler was proposed in 1987 (Duane, et.al.) and uses a simple idea from classical mechanics    

- Attempt to improve convergence of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm   
  * M-H algorithm is slow converging **random walk**  
  * Leads to low ESS      

- Hamiltonian MCMC attempts to create a better directed sampling path   
  * Uses an analogy with classical physics   
  * Constrains the search to favor high-density parts of the posterior distribution   

- Imagine that the posterior density is like a hilly landscape     
   * We want to sample around the high spots, the maximum density points   
   * We call density **potential**     

- We roll an imaginary ball around the landscape to the highest potential energy points  
   * Ball has position and velocity in the space     
   * These high density points attract the ball - a 'field of attraction'      
  

## Hamiltonian MCMC   

The Hamiltonian sampler uses a simple idea from classical mechanics  

- Ball has **potential energy** and **kinetic energy**    
   * **Potential energy** determined by probability density     
   * **Kinetic energy** determined by rate of change of position, **velocity**   

- **Hamiltonian** arise from the principle of **conservation of energy**        

$$\mathtt{H}(q,p) = \mathtt{K}(p,q) + \mathtt{V}(q)$$

- Where:      
   * $p =$ momentum vector           
   * $q =$ position vector       
   * $\mathtt{K}(p,q) =$ kinetic energy    
   * $\mathtt{V}(q) =$ potential energy   

- The Hamiltonian, $\mathtt{H}(q,p)$, of the system **must remain constant** over the sample space

## Hamiltonian MCMC   

The Hamiltonian sampler uses a simple idea from classical mechanics    

- We can relate position and momentum to the density we want to sample    

- The **Boltzmann distribution** of the Hamiltonian

$$p(q,p) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{\mathtt{H}(q,p)}{kT}}$$

- Where:    
   * $Z =$ normalization or **partition coefficient**   
   * $k =$ scale parameter    
   * $T =$ temperature    
  
## Hamiltonian MCMC   

The Hamiltonian sampler uses a simple idea from classical mechanics  

- **Hamiltonian** arise from the principle of **conservation of energy**        

$$\mathtt{H}(q,p) = \mathtt{K}(p,q) + \mathtt{V}(q)$$

- Solve for velocity and momentum as system of coupled differential equations:  

\begin{align}
\frac{d\ q}{d\ t} &= \frac{\partial \mathtt{H}}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial \mathtt{K}}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial \mathtt{V}}{\partial p}\\

\frac{d\ p}{d\ t} &= \frac{\partial \mathtt{H}}{\partial q} = \frac{\partial \mathtt{K}}{\partial q} + \frac{\partial \mathtt{V}}{\partial q}
\end{align}

- Notice that **HMCMC only works for distributions with finite derivatives!**    
   * Works for nearly all continuous distributions   
   * **Cannot be applied to discrete distributions**     

- The above is rather intimidating, and we skip the details!  

## Hamiltonian MCMC

Hamiltonian MCMC is an extension of the M-H algorithm with steps:    

1. Sample $p \sim \mathtt{N}(0,\sigma)$      
2. Simulate $q_t$ and $p_t$ for L time intervals with $\epsilon$ time steps, using the coupled differential equations   
3. Get $q_L$ as the new proposed state     
4. Apply the M-H acceptance criteria to $q_L$

- Must find good hyperparameter values of $L$ and $\epsilon$ to **tune** the algorithm    
  * Change too small, search is only local    
  * Change too large, search makes large jumps   
   
- Hard to find good hyperparameter values, $L$ and $\epsilon$, in practice      



## No U-Turn Sampler   

NUTS represents the state of the art in MCMC samplers: [Hoffman and Gelman](stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/nuts.pdf) 2014         
   
- PyMC3 package uses the NUTS MCMC algorithm.    

- NUTS improves on HMC     
  * Run time forward and backward when solving coupled differential equations   
  * Find equilibrium at the **no U-turn point**   
  * Equilibrium point determines $L$ and $\epsilon$ automatically  
  * Eliminates tuning    


- Why even discuss other samplers when we have NUTS?       
   - NUTS works well in many common continuous distribution cases, it is not guaranteed to converge    
   - In some cases a Gibbs sampler works better  
   - Use M-H for discrete distributions

## Key Steps for MCMC Bayes Modeling     

Steps of modern Bayes modeling and evaluation   

1. Define the problem    
2. Collect the dataset   
3. Define a model, including priors   
4. Prior predictive checks - are the priors reasonable for the problem?  
5. MCMC sample the model      
6. Verify MCMC sampling convergence and sufficiency   
7. Posterior predictive checks - Do the posterior predictions agree with the observed response?  

Packages like [ArviZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/index.html) are dedicated to evaluation of Bayes MCMC models.     

Multiple examples diagnostics for the breakdown of MCMC sampling can be found in an online Appendix to a seminal paper [Vehtari  et.al.](https://avehtari.github.io/rhat_ess/rhat_ess.html#references), 2019


## Constructing an MCMC Model with PyMC

Define and construct a simple linear regression model 

- Simple dataset:    
   * Dependent variable $Y$      
   * Independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$ 

```{r RegressionData, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='Data for regression example', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/BayesRegressionData.jpg"))
```


## Constructing an MCMC Model with PyMC

Define and construct a simple linear regression model 

- Model has 4 parameters    

- Define prior distributions for these parameters:    

\begin{align}   
\beta_0 &\sim \mathtt{N}(0, 2)\\
\beta_1 &\sim \mathtt{N}(0, 2)\\
\beta_2 &\sim \mathtt{N}(0, 2)\\
\sigma &\sim |\mathtt{N}(0, 1)
\end{align} 

- $\beta_0$ is the intercept term    
- $\beta_1, \beta_2$ are the partial slopes     
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation     
- $|\mathtt{N}(.,.)$, indicates a **half Normal distribution**           

## Constructing an MCMC Model with PyMC

Define and construct a simple linear regression model    

- Model has 4 parameters, $[\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \sigma]$   

- Likelihood model:       
   * Start with independent variables, $x_1, x_2$,      
   * Sample posterior of parameters    
   * Posterior distribution (**likelihood**) of observations, $Y$:    

$$Y \sim \mathtt{N}(\mu, \sigma)$$
    
   * Expected value of the response, $\mu$ is **computed deterministically**:   
$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * x_1 + \beta_2 * x_2$$

## Constructing an MCMC Model with PyMC

Define and construct a simple linear regression model 

- Use Python PyMC package to construct the model 


```{python, eval=FALSE}
with pymc3.Model() as regression_model:
    # Priors for unknown model parameters
    betas = pymc3.Normal("betas", mu=0, sigma=2, shape=3)
    sigma = pymc3.HalfNormal("sigma", sigma=1)

    # Deterministic expected value of outcome
    mu = betas[0] + betas[1] * x1 + betas[2] * x2

    # Likelihood (sampling distribution) of observations
    Y_obs = pymc3.Normal("Y_obs", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=Y)

## Prior Predictive Checks   

Prior predictive checks to verify prior distribution choice   

- Prior predictive checks verify that choices of prior distributions are at least reasonable   
- Compare the distribution of the response variable with the posterior distribution generated by priors.   
   * Is the posterior distribution in the absence of evidence (data) 

```{r PriorResponse, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='Prior predictive response vs response variable distribution', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/PriorPredictiveResponse.jpg"))
```

- Example looks promising    
   * Distribution shape is similar    
   * No noticeable anomalies    
   * Higher dispersion of prior check distribution is desired to not restrict the solution   



## Prior Predictive Checks   

Prior predictive checks to verify prior distribution choice   

- Prior predictive checks verify that choices of prior distributions are at least reasonable   
- Verify that we are happy with the density of the $\beta$ and $\sigma$ priors 

```{r PriorBetas, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='Prior density of Betas and sigma', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/PriorBetas.png"))
```

- Shape of these distributions seems reasonable   
   * Range of possible values will not restrict the solution    
   * No anomalies in the shape of the distribution   
   
## Sampling and Inference with Model    

Evaluation the sampled posterior and perform inference     

- We sample the posterior using one or more Markov chains     

- Examine the traces (path of chains)    

```{r Traces, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='Traces and posterior density of MCMC traces', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/PosteriorTraces.png"))
```

- Traces and density of chains are similar      
   * No divergence between traces  
   
- 2 $\beta$s have limited uncertainty   
   * $\beta_2$ has high uncertainty as expected      
   
- $\sigma$ has limited uncertainty   

## Sampling and Inference with Model    

Evaluation the sampled posterior and perform inference   

- There are a number of ways MCMC sampling can breakdown and not converge;

```{r BadTraces, out.width = '70%', fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/BadTraces.png"))
```

Example from [Vehtari et.al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08008.pdf), 2021, a seminal paper on evaluation of MCMC    

## Sampling and Inference with Model    

We must verify that the samples are representative 

```{r MCMC_table, out.width = '50%', fig.cap='Table of MCMC convergence statistics', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MCMC_table.png"))
```

A lot of information in this summary table       

1. The mean MCMC error      
   * Estimated error tells us how much error the MCMC sampling has introduced             
2. The standard deviation (`sd`) of the mean error of the posterior distribution
3. Metrics of **effective sample size (ESS)**     
   * ESS of bulk (middle) portion of posterior distributions   
   * ESS for tails ESS of posterior distributions       
4. The **Gelman-Rudin statistic** ($\hat{R}$) measures the ratio of the **variance shrinkage between chains** to the **variance shrinkage within chains**    
   * Gelman-Rudin statistic should converge to 1.0   
   * If all chains converge, the reduction in variance between chains and within the chains should is same
   
## Sampling and Inference with Model    

We must verify that the samples are representative   

- Plot the MCSE by quantile for each model parameter   

```{r MCSE_plot, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='MCSE by quantile for each model parameter', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MCSE_plot.png"))
```
  
- Ideally want MCSE to be **small and uniform** with quantile      
 
- Notice the MCSE is higher for outer quantiles   
   * Not an unusual situation since less sampling in thin tails of distributions    
   * Overall MCSE is low, even in tails       
   
## Sampling and Inference with Model    

We must verify that the samples are representative   

- Plot the ESS locally and by quantile for each model parameter   

```{r ESS_plot, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='ESS locally and by quantile for each model parameter', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/ESS_plot.png"))
```   

- Ideally want ESS to be **large and uniform** with quantile     

- Local ESS is fairly uniform with quantile  
 
- Notice the quantile ESS is lower for outer quantiles   
   * Not an unusual situation since less sampling in thin tails of distributions    
   * Overall ESS is reasonably high, even in tails     
   
## Sampling and Inference with Model    

Evaluate the sampled posterior and perform inference     

- Examine HDIs of model parameters by trace with **tree plot**       

```{r ParameterHDI, out.width = '50%', fig.cap='HDIs of model parameters by trace', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/ParameterHDI.png"))
```

- HDIs are similar for each parameter by trace      

- HDIs confirm inferences on uncertainty of the model parameters


## Sampling and Inference with Model    

Evaluate the sampled posterior and perform inference   

- How can we interpret the results?

```{r PosteriorHDI, out.width = '80%', fig.cap='Posterior distribution of parameters with HDIs', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/PosteriorHDI.png"))
```

- Interpret $\beta$s by examining HDIs           
   * $\beta_0$ is the mean response for the centered independent variable     
   * $\beta_1$ is partial slope with respect to $x_1$       
   * $\beta_2$ coefficient large compared to $\beta_1$ with high uncertainty            
   
- $\sigma$ has small value with limited uncertainty   


## Posterior Predictive Checks       

We must check that predictions from the model are reasonable      

- Does the posterior distribution look like the distribution of the observed response?    

- Can simply compare density plots    

- Apply a test statistic $T$   
   * Bayesian p-value      
   * Bayesian u-value    
   * Others   

## Posterior Predictive Checks       

We must check that predictions from the model are reasonable      

- Base statistic on **posterior predictive distribution**   

- Approximate PPD by resampling from the posterior distribution:    

$$p(y^{rep}|y)= \sum_i p(y^{rep}|\theta) p(\theta|y)$$

Where:   
$y^{rep} =$ realization drawn from the posterior distribution  
$y =$ observation  
$p(y^{rep}|\theta) =$ draw from posterior distribution with parameters $\theta$    
$p(\theta|y) =$ posterior distribution of model parameters, $\theta$    

- We can sample the posterior as many times as required to get better estimates of $p(y^{rep}|y)$ 

## Posterior Predictive Checks       

We must check that predictions from the model are reasonable      

- Posterior predictive distribution is compared to the distribution of observations  

```{r PosteriorPredictive, out.width = '60%', fig.cap='Posterior predictive distribution vs. observed responses', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/PosteriorPredictive.png"))
```

- Agreement is generally good between posterior predictive and actual observations    

- Average predictive is heavier in the tails    


## Posterior Predictive Checks       

We must check that predictions from the model are reasonable      

- **Bayesian p-value** is a test statistic, $T$, for the distribution differences between observed and predicted responses:  

$$p = p(y^{rep} < y | y )$$
  
- Intuitively, for representative posterior, $p = 0.5$ over many draws of $y^{rep}$   
   * $y^{rep} < y | y$ half the time    
   * $y^{rep} > y | y$ half the time  
   * Distribution should be symmetric   
   



## Posterior Predictive Checks       

We must check that predictions from the model are reasonable      

- Posterior predictive Bayesian p-value     

```{r BayesianPValue, out.width = '60%', fig.cap='Distribution of Bayesian p-values', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/BayesianPValue.png"))
```

- Plot is centered on 0.5     

- Distribution is symmetric   



## Posterior Predictive Checks       

We must check that predictions from the model are reasonable      

- Posterior predictive **Bayesian u-value** is also known as the **marginal p-value**:   

$$p_i = p(y_i^{rep} < y_i | y )$$

- U-value computed for specific (ordered) observation $y_i$    
  * $p_i$ should be centered on 1.0    
  * $p_i$ should be close to uniformly distributed    


```{r LocalPValue, out.width = '60%', fig.cap='Distribution of Bayesian u-values', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/LocalPValue.png"))
```

- The values are close to 1.0 across all values of the observatons    


## British Coal Mine Disasters   

Analysis of change point in British coal mine disasters     

- Toward the end of 19th Century was growing public awareness of the rising coal mine deaths   
- Mine disaster defined as incident leading to 6 or more deaths     

- As early as 1886, Royal Commission published recommendations for safety practices     
   * Adoption of these practices remained voluntary     
   * [British Coal Mines Act of 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Mines_Act_1911) finally codified mine safety procedures into law.  


## British Coal Mine Disasters   

Analysis of change point in British coal mine disasters     

- Famous dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nabamitachakraborty/coal-mine-disastersuk), and other sources    

- Goal to create a model to quantify the differences in the rate of mine disasters before and after the introduction of safety practices      

- Example of a **point process model**     

- Point process model has an **intensity** or **rate** of occurrence of events, e.g. mine disasters     

- Number events over a time period for this type of point process is iid       
   * The number of events per time period are a iid draw from some probability distribution    
   * Because of the iid nature of the point process, no autoregressive (AR) effect    

## British Coal Mine Disasters   

Analysis of change point in British coal mine disasters     

- iid nature of the point process does not mean the distribution of the process cannot change in time     

- **Change points** or **switch points** in time are quite common in the real-world    
   * Rates changes at change point    
   * Rate constant betwen change point    
   * Identifying these change points is often a challenging problem

```{r MineDisasters, out.width = '50%', fig.cap='Number of disasters per year 1851-1962', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MineDisasters.png"))
```

- Two related questions we can ask about these data     
   * At what point in time was there a significant change in intensity, the switch point?     
   * Not obvious, changes in safety practice were adopted over about 25 years       
   * How significant was the reduction in the rate?

Analysis of change point in British coal mine disasters    

- **Poisson likelihood** model with switch switch point $s$, rate before, $e$ and after $l$:     

$$
D_t \sim Pois(r_t),\ r_t = 
\begin{cases}
     e,\ t < s\\
     l,\ t \ge s
\end{cases}
$$

- Prior distributions of parameters, uniform and exponential:    

\begin{align}   
s &\sim unif(t_{min}, t_{max})\\
e &\sim exp(2) \\    
l &\sim exp(2)
\end{align}

    # Uniform prior on the switch point  
    switchpoint = pymc3.DiscreteUniform("switchpoint", lower=disaster_data.Year.min(), upper=disaster_data.Year.max())
    # More informative prior based on domain knowledge

#    switchpoint = pymc3.Laplace("switchpoint", mu=1900, b=4.0)

    # Priors for pre- and post-switch rates 
    early_rate = pymc3.Exponential("early_rate", 2.0)
    late_rate = pymc3.Exponential("late_rate", 2.0)

    # Poisson rate switch for years before and after current
    rate = pymc3.math.switch(switchpoint >= disaster_data.Year, early_rate, late_rate)

    disasters = pymc3.Poisson("disasters", rate, observed=disaster_data.Count)

## Summary      

For complex Bayesian models we need a computationally efficient aproximation     

- Grid sampling is inefficient        

- MCMC sampling is based on Markov chains    
   - Markov process is memoryless    
   - Sampling converges to probability distribution    

- Several MCMC sampling methods have been developed     
   - Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm uses random sampling with acceptance probability     
   - Gibbs sampling round robins on the dimensions of the parameter space   
   - NUTS    
   
- NUTS is the state of the art MCMC algorithm       
   - Uses a field of attraction to the highest density parts of the parameter space   
   - No hyperparameters to tune
