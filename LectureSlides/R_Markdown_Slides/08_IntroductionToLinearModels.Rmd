## Review      

Bayesian analysis is a contrast to frequentist methods          

-	The objective of Bayesian analysis is to compute a posterior distribution    
  - Contrast with frequentist statistics; computing a point estimate and confidence interval from a sample      


-	Bayesian models allows expressing prior information in the form of a prior distribution    
  - Selection of prior distributions can be performed in a number of ways      

-	The posterior distribution is said to quantify our current **belief**     
   - We update beliefs based on additional data or evidence    
   - A critical difference with frequentist models which must be computed from a complete sample   
-	Inference can be performed on the posterior distribution by finding the maximum a postiori (MAP) value and a credible interval    

- Predictions are made by simulating from the posterior distribution   a



## Introduction - Why linear models? 

Linear models are widely used in statistics and machine learning   

- Understandable and interpretable    

- Generalize well, if properly fit     

- Highly scalable â€“ computationally efficient    

- Can approximate fairly complex functions    
   - A basis of understanding complex models     
   
- Many non-linear models are at locally linear at convergence
   - We can learn a lot about the convergence of DL and RL models from linear approximations    

- In this lesson we take a **frequentist view** of the linear model    
   - Bayesian view is also widely used

## Introduction - Why linear models? 

Linear models are **readily interpretable!**       

- Human interpretability is of great importance for models used for critical decisions    
   - Health care   
   - Safe operation of autonomous systems     
   - Social justice for applications with human impact     
   - etc.    
   
- Model coefficients provide information on response sensitivities to changes in variables    
   - Low chance of *unexpected output*   
   - Complex and nonlinear model result in poor human intuition about expected response    
   - Complex and nonlinear models vulnerable to *unexpected output*    



## Why Linear Models     

What are the alternatives?    

- Linear models are scaleable and interpretable     
    - Idea if **goal is inference and exploration**    
    - Can **identify data problems** more easily  
    - May have lower prediction accuracy on some problems     

- AdaBoost algorithms are go-to models for prediction on tabular data   
    - Known to give superior predicitons, **but clean data matter more!**     
    - Interpretability is nearly impossible   
    - Limits inference and exploration opportunities    



## What is regression?

In statistics, **regression** refers to a family of model that attempt to predict the value of numeric random variable       

- Regression is a common form of a linear model        

- Linear regression is a building block of many statistical and ML methods:   
   - multivariate regression and principal component
   - Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   - Polynomial regression
   - Logistic regression for binary classification
   - Poisson regression  
   - Many time series models   
   - Neural networks (and deep learning)


## Terminology  

The confusing division in terminology arises from different communities within statistics and machine learning

| Machine Learning Terminology | Statistical Terminology          |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------|
| Regression vs classification   | Continuous numeric vs categorical response      |
| Learning algorithm or model    | Model                                |
| Training                       | Fitting                              |
| Trained model                  | Fitted model                         |
| Supervised learning            | Predictive modeling      


## Terminology    

Different communities have created different terminology at different times for the variables in a machine learning models       

Predicted Variable | Variables Used to Predict    
:----------------------- | :------------------------------     
 y | x   
 Dependent | Independent    
 Endogenous | Exogenous    
 Response | Predictor    
 Response | Explanatory    
 Label | Feature    
 Regressand | Regressors    
 Outcome | Design   
 Left Hand Side | Right Hand Side     
 


## Formulating the Linear Model      

The general formulation of a linear model can be written:     

$$\vec{y} = A \vec{b} + \vec{\epsilon}$$

- $\vec{y}$ is the vector of $n$ dependent variables or labels we seek to predict   

- $A$ is the $n$ x $p$ **model matrix** or **design matrix**        
   - Defines the structure of the model    
   - $p$ columns are values of the predictor variables or features 
   - $n$ rows of training cases   
   
- $\vec{b}$ is the vector of $p$ model coefficients      
   - One coefficient for each predictor or feature  
   - Model is fit by finding an **optimal** value for each coefficient  


## Formulating the Linear Model      

The general formulation of a linear model can be written:     

$$\vec{y} = A \vec{b} + \vec{\epsilon}$$

- $\epsilon$ is the vector representing **prediction error**   
   - The $n$ **residuals** 
   - Is **iid Normally distributed**; $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$


## Single Predictor Regression

Consider a simple case of regression with a single predictor   

- Only two coefficients ($p=2$) defining a straight line            

$$
 \vec{b} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- $\beta_0 =$ the **intercept term**       
   - Intercept is value of $y$ at $x=0$       

- $\beta_1 =$ model **coefficient** for the predictor variable     
   - The **slope coefficient**    


## Single Predictor Regression

Consider a simple case of regression with a single predictor   

- Given a variable predictor value $x_i$, the prediction, $\hat{y}_i$, is:

\begin{align}
\hat{y}_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\\
\hat{y}_i &= y - \epsilon_i\\
\epsilon_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align}    

- $\epsilon_i$ is the **0 mean Normally distributed residual**; $\mathtt{E}(\epsilon_i) = 0$



## Example      

Let's start with a simulated data set with one predictor and one response variable   

- The response variable, $y$ is linear in $x$ with additive random noise $\sim \mathcal{N}(0,2)$

- Intercept $= 0$ and slope $=1.0$

- The first 10 rows:

```{python, echo=FALSE}
import numpy as np
import numpy.random as nr
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf   
import statsmodels as sm   
import statsmodels.api as sm_api   
from statsmodels.graphics.regressionplots import influence_plot, plot_regress_exog
import scipy.stats as ss
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from math import sqrt   

# Parameters of generated data
n_points = 50
x_start, x_end = 0, 10
y_start, y_end = 0, 10
y_sd = 2

# Generate data columns
nr.seed(5666)
x_data = np.linspace(x_start, x_end, n_points) # The x values
y_error = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=y_sd, size=n_points) # The Normally distributed noise
y_data = np.linspace(y_start, y_end, n_points) + y_error + 1.0 # The y values including an intercept

# Put data in dataframe
sim_data = pd.DataFrame({'x':x_data, 'y':y_data})

sim_data.head(10)
```


## Example     

Notice the linear trend for these data

```{python, echo=FALSE}
# Matplotlib may give some font errors when loading for the first time, you can ignore 
plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ) 
ax.plot(sim_data['x'], sim_data['y'], 'ko')
plt.grid(True)
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_title('x vs y')
plt.ylim(0,11);
plt.show()
```

How do we compute a best fit model for this relationship 
   

## The Model Matrix      

How do we create the model matrix   

- Start with a data table of $n$ samples with $p=2$ columns         
   - First column is predictor variable    
   - Second column is the response variable   

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1, y_1\\
x_2, y_2\\
x_3, y_3\\
\vdots, \vdots\\
x_n, y_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## The Model Matrix      

The **model matrix** for this case, including the intercept term is:   


$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1, x_1\\
1, x_2\\
1, x_3\\
\vdots, \vdots\\
1, x_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The column of 1's define the intercept term   


## Constructing the Model

For the $n$ data samples and the parameter vector $\vec{b}$ we can construct the entire model:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
\vdots\\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1, x_1\\
1, x_2\\
1, x_3\\
\vdots, \vdots\\
1, x_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1
\end{bmatrix}
+ 
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_1\\
\epsilon_2\\
\epsilon_3\\
\vdots\\
\epsilon_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$
For a single prediction:    

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$


Or, in matrix notation: 

$$\hat{y} = A \vec{b} + \vec{\epsilon}$$

We are assuming that the **error, $\epsilon$, is only attributable to the dependent variable**, $y$         


## Estimating the Model Parameters      

How do we find the best value for the coefficients      

- Need to minimize an **error metric**    

- Find $\vec{b}$ by minimizing the **sum of squared errors** is known as the **least squares** method   

- Given training data, minimize the squared error between the prediction, $\hat{y}_i$, and the observed response variable or label, $y_i$:    

$$\min_{\vec{b}} \sum_i(y_i - A_{i,.} \hat{b})^2 = \min_{\vec{b}} \sum_i(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 =  \min_{\vec{b}} \sum_i \epsilon_i^2$$

$A_{i,.}$ is the ith row of $A$


## Estimating the Model Parameters      

We could try a naive solution:    

$$ \vec{b} = A^{-1}y$$

Where $A^{-1}$ is the **matrix inverse** of $A$     

- This *might work*, **BUT**     

- Direct matrix inverse algorithm has complexity $O(n^3)$, so inefficient   

- There is no guarantee the inverse exists     
   - The $p$ features can be colinear   


## Estimating the Model Parameters   

We can use the **Normal equations**   

- Start with the problem:    

$$y - A \vec{b} = \vec{\epsilon} \rightarrow 0$$

- Multiply by $A^T$ and set $\vec{\epsilon} = 0$    

$$A^TA \vec{b} = A^T \hat{y}$$

- Taking the inverse of $A^T A$ we arrive at the normal equations  

$$\vec{b} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T \hat{y}$$



## Estimating the Model Parameters   

We can use the **Normal equations**   

$$\vec{b} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T \hat{y}$$

- $\frac{1}{p} A^TA$ is the **covariance matrix** for the data set     
   - Is dimension only $p$ x $p$
   - For single predictor model this is just dimension 2x2
   - Much easier to take inverse   
   - But poor scaling for large-scale problems, $p > 1,000$   
   
## Estimating the Model Parameters   

What is the relationship between the normal equations, least squares and maximum likelihood?   

- First consider how the Normal likelihood can be written in terms of $\vec{b}$ with $n$ feature vectors of observations $\vec{x}_i$ and $n$ labels $y_i$:

$$\mathcal{L}(\vec{b}, \sigma^2) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sigma^2)^{1/2}} exp \Big\{ -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \big(y_i - x_i^T \vec{b}  \big)^2 \Big\}$$

- The log-likelihood is then:     

$$\mathcal{l}(\vec{b}, \sigma^2) = -\frac{1}{2} \Bigg\{ n\ log(\sigma^2) + \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \big(y_i - x_i^T \vec{b}  \big)^2  \Bigg\}$$

- For a fixed $\sigma^2$ one can see that the **log-likelihood is maximized by minimizing the squared error:**    

$$SS(\vec{b}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \big(y_i - x_i^T \vec{b}  \big)^2$$

## Estimating the Model Parameters

Minimize sum of square errors to maximize log-likelihood    

- Set the first derivative of sum of square errors to zero

$$\frac{\partial\ SS(\vec{b})}{\partial\ \vec{b}} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^T \big(y_i -  x_i^T \vec{b}  \big) = 0$$
Or, in matrix form:     

$$A^T (\vec{y} - A \vec{b}) = 0$$

- Solving the above leads to the **normal equations:**    

$$\vec{b} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T \hat{y}$$


- But still need to compute inverse of covariance matrix, $A^TA$

## Estimating the Model Parameters   

Are there more scalable ways to solve the least squares problems?      

- Inverting the covariance matrix is a big improvement over a naive approach, it still requires taking a large matrix inverse at scale. $p > 1,000$     

- Can we solve the least squares problem in a more computationally efficient way? 

- Start with the linear equations for maximum likelihood 

$$A^T (\vec{y} - A \vec{b}) = 0$$

- Eliminate $A^T$ from both sides    

$$\vec{y} - A \vec{b} = 0$$

- We can find the minimum of this linear system with an efficient solver   
   - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and its relatives     
   - Quasi-Newton methods like **L-BFGS**


## Estimating the Model Parameters   

What is the relationship between the normal equations, least squares and maximum likelihood?     

- Solving the least problem is equivalent to solving the maximum likelihood estimation problem   

- The normal equations are a maximum likelihood estimator   

- Solving the system of linear equations, $\vec{y} - A \vec{b} = 0$, results in a least squares maximum likelihood solution   

- The above applies when residuals are Normally distributed    



   

## Example - Specifying the Model    

How do we specify the model formula with statsmodels?   

- Use the S/R style model formula developed by [Chambers and Hastie; Statistical Models in S (1992)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203738535).     

- Uses the $\sim$ operator to mean *modeled by**  

$$dependent\ variable\sim indepenent\ variables$$

- Example; dependent variable (dv) modeled by two independent variables (var1 and var2):

$$dv \sim var1 + var2$$

- Example; dependent variable (dv) modeled by independent variables (var1) and its square, uses the $I()$ operator to wrap a function:

$$dv \sim var1 + I(var1**2)$$


## Example - Specifying the Model    

How do we specify the model formula with statsmodels?   

- Example; dependent variable (dv) is modeled by two independent variables (var1 and var2) and the **interaction term** with no intercept term:

$$
dv \sim -1 + var1*var2 \longleftrightarrow
dv \sim -1 + var1 + var2 + var1:var2
$$ 

- Example; dependent variable (dv) modeled by independent numeric variable (var1) and a categorical variable (var2):

$$dv \sim var1 + C(var2)$$


## Example - Fitting the Model

Fit the model using statsmodels.formula.api.ols to create a linear model object    

```{python}
## Define the regression model and fit it to the data
ols_model = smf.ols(formula = 'y ~ x', data=sim_data).fit()

## Print the model coefficient
print('Intercept = %4.3f  Slope = %4.3f' % (ols_model._results.params[0], ols_model._results.params[1]))
```

Find the predicted values for each value of $x$:  

```{python}
# Add predicted to pandas dataframe
sim_data['predicted'] = ols_model.predict(sim_data.x)
# View head of data frame
sim_data.head(5)
```


## Example - Model Checking    

Plot the regression line against the original data    

```{python, echo=FALSE}
plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ); 
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted', data=sim_data, color='red', ax=ax);
sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=sim_data, ax=ax);
ax.set_title('Scatter plot of original data with linear regression line');
ax.set_ylim(0,11);
plt.show();
```

This looks like a good fit, but how good is it really? 




## Evaluating Regression Models    

Evaluation of regression models focuses on the residuals or errors     

$$\vec{\epsilon} = \vec{y} - A\ \vec{b} = \vec{y} - \hat{y}$$

- Residuals should be Normally distributed with $0$ mean and constant variance    

$$\vec{\epsilon} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$

- The residuals must be **homoskedastic** with respect to the fitted values    
    - Homoskedastic residuals have constant variance with predicted values    
    
- Any trend or structure in the residuals indicates a poor model fit    
   - In these cases variance is not constant and we say these are **heteroskedastic** residuals       
   - Heteroskedastic residuals indicate that model has not incorporated all available information   



## Evaluating Regression Models      

**Residual plots** is a key diagnostic for any regression model   

- Plot residual against the predicted values    

```{python, echo=FALSE}
# Add residuals to pandas dataframe
sim_data['resids'] = np.subtract(sim_data.predicted, sim_data.y)

def residual_plot(df):
    plt.rc('font', size=12)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3), ) 
    RMSE = np.std(df.resids)
    sns.scatterplot(x='predicted', y='resids', data=df, ax=ax);
    plt.axhline(0.0, color='red', linewidth=1.0);
    plt.axhline(2.0*RMSE, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1.0);
    plt.axhline(-2.0*RMSE, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1.0);
    plt.title('PLot of residuals vs. predicted');
    plt.xlabel('Predicted values');
    plt.ylabel('Residuals');
    plt.show()
    
residual_plot(sim_data)  
#sns.scatterplot(x='predicted', y='resids', data=sim_data)
#plt.show()
```

- These residuals look homoskedastic - we are happy! 


## Evaluating Regression Models   

Graphically test that the residuals are iid Normal   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
def plot_resid_dist(resids):
    plt.rc('font', size=12)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 3));
    ## Plot a histogram
    sns.histplot(x=resids, bins=20, kde=True, ax=ax[0]);
    ax[0].set_title('Histogram of residuals');
    ax[0].set_xlabel('Residual values');
    ## Plot the Q-Q Normal plot
    ss.probplot(resids, plot = ax[1]);
    ax[1].set_title('Q-Q Normal plot of residuals');
    plt.show();

plot_resid_dist(sim_data.resids)
```

- These plots look promising   


## Evaluating Regression Models  

We can quantitatively understand model performance by defining these relationships     

\begin{align}
SST &= sum\ square\ total\ = \Sigma_i(y_i - \bar{Y})^2 \\
SSE &= sum\ square\ explained\ = \Sigma_i{(\hat{y_i} - \bar{Y})^2}\\
SSR &= sum\ square\ residual\ = \Sigma_i{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}\\
\end{align}

The relationship between these metrics: 

$$SST = SSR + SSE$$

Or, we can say that the sum of squares explained by the model is:   

$$SSE = SST - SSR$$

## Evaluating Regression Models    

Compute the sums of squares for the running example   

```{python}
y_bar = np.mean(sim_data.y)
SST = np.sum(np.square(np.subtract(sim_data.y, y_bar)))
SSR = np.sum(np.square(sim_data.resids))
SSE = np.sum(np.square(np.subtract(sim_data.predicted, y_bar)))
print('SST = {0:6.2f}'.format(SST))
print('SSE = {0:6.2f}'.format(SSE))
print('SSR = {0:6.2f}'.format(SSR))
print('SSE + SSR = {0:6.2f}'.format(SSE + SSR))
```

- The model has explained most of the SST   


## Evaluating Regression Models    

We can compare the sum of square residual to the sum of square total to evaluate how well our model explains the data    

$$SST - SSR = SSE$$
We call the ratio $\frac{SSE}{SST}$ $R^2$ or the **coefficient of determination**  

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}$$

The $R^2$ for a perfect model would behave as follows:   

\begin{align}
SSR &\rightarrow 0\\
R^2 &\rightarrow 1
\end{align}

A model which does not explain the data at all has: 

\begin{align}
SSR &\rightarrow SST \\ 
R^2 &\rightarrow 0
\end{align}


## Evaluating Regression Models  

As the number of model parameters increases the model will fit the data better  

- But, the model will become over-fit as the number of parameters increases    

- Must adjust model performance for degrees of freedom - **adjusted** $R^2$


\begin{align}
R^2_{adj} &= 1 - \frac{\frac{SSR}{df_{SSR}}}{\frac{SST}{df_{SST}}} = 1 - \frac{var_{residual}}{var_{total}}\\
where\\
df_{SSR} &= SSR\ degrees\ of\ freedom\\
df_{SST} &= SST\ degrees\ of\ freedom
\end{align}

This gives $R^2_{adj}$ as:

\begin{align}
R^2_{adj} &= 1 - (1 - R^2) \frac{n - 1}{n - k}\\ 
where\\
n &= number\ of\ data\ samples\\
k &= number\ of\ model\ coefficients
\end{align}

## Evaluating Regression Models  

As the number of model parameters increases the model will fit the data better 

We can expression $R^2_{adj}$:   

\begin{align}
R^2_{adj} &= 1 - (1 - R^2) \frac{n - 1}{n - k}\\ 
where\\
n &= number\ of\ data\ samples\\
k &= number\ of\ model\ coefficients
\end{align}

Or, we can rewrite $R^2_{adj}$ as:

$$R^2_{adj} =  1.0 - \frac{SSR}{SST}  \frac{n - 1}{n - 1 - k}$$



## Evaluating Regression Models  

The summary table for the OLS model provides a number of summary statistics

```{python}
ols_model.summary()
```


## Evaluating Regression Models  

The summary table for the OLS model provides a number of summary statistics

- **Model coefficients**, with an hypothesis test on the statistical significance  

- **F-statistic** and **Prob (F-statistic)** are a measure of the significance of the model against a **null model that does not explain the data**.     

- [**Omnibus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_test), which is a test on the likelihood ratio between the model and a null model     

- The $R^2$ and **adjusted $R^2$** indicate the sum of squares explained:   
  - The **number of observations**, the $df_{SST}$    
  - The **degrees of freedom residuals**, $df_{SSR}$    
  -  $df_{SST} - df_{SSR} =$ number of model coefficients     
  
- [**Jarque-Bera**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarque%E2%80%93Bera_test) statistic is a test on the skewness and krutosis of the residuals    

- The **Condition number** a measure of how well defined the solution is to the system of linear is      
  


## Evaluating Regression Models   

We also can evaluate models by error metrics

- The **root mean square error (RMSE)** is a measure of the mean of the squared residuals

$$RMSE =  \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma^n_{i-1} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{SSR}{n}}$$

```{python}
print('RMSE = {0:6.2}'.format(sqrt(np.sum(np.square(sim_data.resids)))/ float(sim_data.shape[0])))
```

- The **median absolute error (MAE)** is a robust measure of mean residuals

$$MAE = med \big[ |y_i - \hat{y_i}| \big]$$

```{python}
print('MAE= {0:6.2}'.format(np.median(np.absolute(sim_data.resids))))
```

- And many more possibilities...



## Evaluating Regression Models

When evaluating any machine learning model consider **all evaluation methods available**    

- No one method is most important all of the time    

- **Different methods highlight different problems** with your model     

- Don't forget to check that the **model must make sense** for your application! 


## Example - Fitting Centered Model

Fit the model using statsmodels.formula.api.ols with **centered independent variable** to create a linear model object    

```{python}
## Center the independent variable   
sim_data.loc[:,'x_centered'] = np.subtract(sim_data.x, np.mean(sim_data.x))
## Define the regression model and fit it to the data
ols_model_centered = smf.ols(formula = 'y ~ x_centered', data=sim_data).fit()

## Print the model coefficient
print('Intercept = %4.3f  Slope = %4.3f' % (ols_model_centered._results.params[0], ols_model_centered._results.params[1]))
```

- We can now interpret this model    
  - Intercept is the mean of the dependent variable   
  - Slope is the rate of change of the dependent variable for unit change in independent variable   
  
- Interceopt is value of independent variable where independent varaibles all $= 0$   
  - May not even be in defined range of independent varaible    
  - e.g. How can we interpret a negaive life expectancy   

## Example - Fitting center Model 

Plot the regression line against the centered independent variable    

```{python, echo=FALSE}
sim_data.loc[:,'predicted_centered'] = ols_model_centered.predict(sim_data)   
plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ); 
sns.lineplot(x='x_centered', y='predicted_centered', data=sim_data, color='red', ax=ax);
sns.scatterplot(x='x_centered', y='y', data=sim_data, ax=ax);
ax.axvline(0, linestyle='dashed', color='gray');
ax.axhline(np.mean(sim_data.y), linestyle='dashed', color='gray');
ax.set_title('Scatter plot of centered linear regression line');
ax.set_ylim(0,11);
plt.show();
#sim_data.drop(['predicted_centered'])
```



## Extending the Linear Model

We extend the linear model by adding new features or predictor variables    

- Higher order terms - e.g. polynomial regression    

- Other exogenous variables 

- We prefer the simplest model that does a reasonable job   
   - The principle of **Occam's razor**  

- Must consider the **bias-variance trade-off**     

- **High complexity model** fits the training data well     
   - **Low bias**
   - But might not generalize well to new cases - **high variance**     
   
- **Lower complexity model** can **generalize** to new cases     
   - **low variance**   
   - But does not fit training data as well - **high bias**


## Extending the Linear Model

Building a model matrix for a more complex linear model is easy   

- We now have $p + 1$ model coefficients, including intercept term   
   
$$\vec{b} = [\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_p]$$   

- With $p$ features the model matrix is: 

$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1, x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, \ldots, x_{1,p}\\
1, x_{2,1}, x_{2,2}, \ldots, x_{2,p}\\
1, x_{3,1}, x_{3,2}, \ldots, x_{3,p}\\
\vdots,\ \vdots,\ \vdots,\ \vdots,\ \vdots\\
1, x_{n,1}, x_{n,2}, \ldots, x_{n,p}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- We still seek the least squares solution     

- The covariance matrix is now $p+1$ x $p+1$, including intercept term


## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model   

A new simulated data set

```{python, echo=FALSE}
# Parameters of generated data
n_points = 50
x_start, x_end = -5, 5
y_start, y_end = 0, 10
y_sd = 10
second_order_coefficient = 1.0

# Generate data columns
nr.seed(5677)
x_data = np.linspace(x_start, x_end, n_points) # The x values
y_error = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=y_sd, size=n_points) # The Normally distributed noise
y_data = x_data + np.multiply(np.square(x_data), second_order_coefficient) + y_error + 1.0 # The y values including an intercept

# Put data in data frame
sim_data_2 = pd.DataFrame({'x':x_data, 'y':y_data})

plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ) 
ax.plot(sim_data['x'], sim_data_2['y'], 'ko');
plt.grid(True);
ax.set_xlabel('x');
ax.set_ylabel('y');
ax.set_title('x vs y');
plt.show();
```

## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model   

First, try a simple straight line model with intercept and slope terms    


```{python, echo=FALSE}
## Define the regression model and fit it to the data
ols_model_2 = smf.ols(formula = 'y ~ x', data=sim_data_2).fit()

## Print the model coefficient
print('Intercept = %4.3f  Slope = %4.3f' % (ols_model_2._results.params[0], ols_model_2._results.params[1]))

# Add predicted to pandas data frame
sim_data_2['predicted'] = ols_model_2.predict(sim_data_2.x)

## Display the results 
plt.rc('font', size=12);
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ); 
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted', data=sim_data_2, color='red', ax=ax);
sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=sim_data_2, ax=ax);
ax.set_title('Scatter plot of original data with linear regression line');
plt.show();
```

## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

What do the residuals look like? 

```{python, echo=FALSE}
# Add residuals to pandas dataframe
sim_data_2['resids'] = np.subtract(sim_data_2.predicted, sim_data_2.y)
    
residual_plot(sim_data_2)
```


- These residuals look heteroskedastic! 


## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

Test that the residuals are iid Normal   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
plot_resid_dist(sim_data_2.resids)
```


- Do these residuals have Normal distribution? 

## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

The model summary is:

```{python, echo=FALSE}
ols_model_2.summary()
```


## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

Let's add a second order polynomial term, so the model is now:    

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2$$

```{python, echo=FALSE}
## Define the regression model and fit it to the data
ols_model_3 = smf.ols(formula = 'y ~ x + I(x**2)', data=sim_data_2).fit()

# Add predicted to pandas data frame
sim_data_2['predicted'] = ols_model_3.predict(sim_data_2.x)

## Print the model coefficient
print('Intercept = %4.3f  Partial Slope = %4.3f  Second Order Partial slope = %4.3f' % (ols_model_3._results.params[0], ols_model_3._results.params[1], ols_model_3._results.params[2]))

## Display the results 
plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ) 
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted', data=sim_data_2, color='red', ax=ax);
sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=sim_data_2, ax=ax);
ax.set_title('Scatter plot of original data with linear regression line');
plt.show();
```


## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

What do the residuals look like with the second order term? 

```{python, echo=FALSE}
# Add residuals to pandas dataframe
sim_data_2['resids'] = np.subtract(sim_data_2.predicted, sim_data_2.y)
    
residual_plot(sim_data_2)
```


- These residuals are close to homoskedastic! 


## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

Test that the residuals are iid Normal for the polynomial model   

```{python, echo=FALSE}
plot_resid_dist(sim_data_2.resids)
```


- Do these residuals have close to a Normal distribution? 

## Example of Multi-Feature Linear Model 

The second order model summary is:

```{python, echo=FALSE}
ols_model_3.summary()
```


## Linear Model Assumptions

There are a number of assumptions in linear models that you overlook at your peril!  

- The feature or predictor variables should be **independent** of one another      
   - This is rarely true in practice   
   - **Multi-colinearity** between features makes the model **under-determined**    

- We assume that numeric features or predictors have zero mean and about the same scale    
   - We do not want to bias the estimation of regression coefficients with predictors that do not have a 0 mean   
   - We do not want to have predictors with a large numeric range dominate training   
   - Example: income is in the range of 10s or 100s of thousands and age is in the range of 10s, but apriori income is no more important than age as a predictor  
   
- Values of each predictor or feature should be iid      
   - If variance changes with sample, the optimal value of the coefficient could not be constant    
   - If there **serial correlation** in the predictor values, the iid assumption is violated - but can account for this such as in time series models   



## Dealing With Outliers  

Outliers are a persistent problem with statistical and machine learning models   

- What are outliers?    
   - Errors or noisy measurements    
   - Result of improper stratification    

- But, may be of interest    
   - Depending on the application, outliers can be the **most interesting values**!!    
   - May need to explicitly model 
   - Example: Fraud detection   
   - Example: Scientific discovery  
   
- Outliers can be hard to detect   
   - Difficult in high-dimensions   
   - Often find by influence on model   


## Dealing With Outliers   

Example: Add a single outlier regression data set

```{python, echo=FALSE}
## add an outlier to the data 
new_row = [0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
new_row_index = len(sim_data)
sim_data_ol = sim_data.copy()
sim_data_ol.loc[new_row_index] = new_row

## Define the regression model and fit it to the data
ols_model_ol = smf.ols(formula = 'y ~ x', data=sim_data_ol).fit()

# Add predicted to pandas data frame
sim_data_ol['predicted_ol'] = ols_model_ol.predict(sim_data_ol.x)

## Print the model coefficient
print('Intercept = %4.3f  Partial Slope = %4.3f' % (ols_model_ol._results.params[0], ols_model_ol._results.params[1]))

## Display the results 
plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ) 
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted', data=sim_data, color='black', linestyle='dotted', ax=ax, label='OLS, no outlier');
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted_ol', data=sim_data_ol, color='red', ax=ax, label='OLS w Outlier');
sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=sim_data_ol, ax=ax);
ax.set_title('Scatter plot of original data with linear regression line');
plt.legend();
plt.show();
```

This outlier has **high leverage** and changes the slope significantly   


## Dealing With Outliers 

**Cook's distance**, $D_i$, measures the influence of an outlier on a model    

- Cook's distance for the ith data point is the degree of freedom adjusted average squared error against a model without this value   

$$D_i = \frac{\Sigma_{j=1}^n (\hat{Y}_j - \hat{Y}_{j(i)})^2}{n (p+1)\hat{\sigma^2}}$$
where,  
$\hat{Y}_{j} =$ the jth prediction computed with all observations         
$\hat{Y}_{j(i)} =$ the jth prediction computed without the ith observation   
$p =$ number of parameters   
$n =$ number of data points    

- Cook's distance is computed using a **leave-one-out resampling algorithm!**

## Dealing With Outliers     

Plot Cook's distance as **leverage** vs. the residual size     

```{python}
_=influence_plot(ols_model_ol)
```

- Outlying points shown at edges of plot    
   - Not all outliers have high leverage   
   - Can detect outliers in moderate dimensions   



## Dealing With Outliers  

Why are linear models sensitive to outliers    

- Ordinary linear regression uses **squared error loss** function    
   - Optimal if the errors are iid Normal   
   - Is an **unbiased estimator**   
   
- In 1-dimension median is robust to outliers   
   - But far from an optimal estimator     
   - High bias  
   - Hard to implement beyond 1-dimension  
   
- We can study the response of estimators to outliers using an **influence function**   




## Dealing With Outliers  

Compare the influence functions of the mean and median estimators  

- Mean estimator has linear influence function    
   - Influence of outliers is **unbounded**  
   - Derivative of the influence function is constant     
   
- Influence function of median estimator is discontinuous    
   - Influence of any observation is constant   
   - Derivative of influence function is not defined  

```{r MeanMedianInfluence, out.width = '25%', fig.cap='Influence functions for mean and median', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/MeanMedianInfluence.png"))
```   


*Figure from Hampel, el.al., Robust Statistics, 1986* 


## Dealing With Outliers  

Could we simply edit out the outliers?    

- But what fraction of the data are outliers?    

- Know as the **alpha trimmed mean** algorithm    
   - Order the values and remove $\alpha / 2$ highest and lowest   
   - But, alpha trimming is a bit arbitrary   
   - Is a biased estimator, with bias increasing with $\alpha$   
   - $\alpha = 0.5$ is the median

- Alpha trimming hard to implement in higher dimensions  

```{r AlphaTrimming, out.width = '25%', fig.cap='Influence functions for alpha trimmed mean', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/AlphaTrimming.png"))
```   


*Figure from Hampel, el.al., Robust Statistics, 1986*   



## Dealing With Outliers  

Are there better estimators when outliers are present    

- Yes, but must accept some bias     

- Idea; estimator can be unbiased near the expected value, but limit influence of outliers    
   - Trade-off between high robustness and low bias

- Many ideas have been tried      
   - A major research focus in the 1970s and 1980s    
   - **Huber estimator**    
   - Family of **M-estimators**  

## Dealing With Outliers  

What are the properties of the Huber estimator?   

- Influence function is linear near the mean but constant away from the mean   
   - **hinge point** is at $\pm t * MAD$, where $MAD =$ **median absolute deviation**   
   - Robustness and bias increases as $t$ decreases
   
- Huber estimator is low bias      
   - Unbiased for samples near the point estimate   
   - Constant influence away from the point estimate    


```{r Huber, out.width = '40%', fig.cap='Influence function of the Huber estimator', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/Huber.png"))
```   


*Figure from Hampel, el.al., Robust Statistics, 1986*


## Dealing With Outliers  

**M-estimators** tapper influence to zero     

- Approximately linear influence near point estimate      
   - So nearly unbiased near the point estimate   

- Influence tappers to 0 for extreme outliers    

- An example is **Tukey's biweight**      
   - Only a single parameter for biweight function, $r$   
   - Robustness and bias increase with decreasing $r$


```{r TukeysBiweight, out.width = '40%', fig.cap='Influence function of the Tukey\'s Biweight M-estimator', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("../images/TukeysBiweight.png"))
```   


*Figure from Hampel, el.al., Robust Statistics, 1986*   



## Dealing With Outliers 

Example: regression with Huber loss function 

```{python}
## Define the robust regression model and fit it to the data
ols_model_huber = smf.rlm(formula ='y~x', data = sim_data_ol).fit()
# Add predicted to pandas data frame
sim_data_ol['predicted_huber'] = ols_model_huber.predict(sim_data_ol.x)
## Display sumamry
ols_model_huber.summary()
```



## Dealing With Outliers 

Example: regression with Huber loss function 


```{python, echo=FALSE}
## Print the model coefficient
#print('Intercept = %4.3f  Partial Slope = %4.3f' % (ols_model_huber._results.params[0], ols_model_huber._results.params[1]))

## Display the results 
plt.rc('font', size=12)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5), ) 
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted', data=sim_data, color='black', linestyle='dotted', ax=ax, label='OLS, no outlier');
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted_huber', data=sim_data_ol, color='black', linestyle='-', ax=ax, lw=2, label='Huber w outliner');
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='predicted_ol', data=sim_data_ol, color='red', ax=ax, label='OLS w outlier');
sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=sim_data_ol, ax=ax);
ax.set_title('Scatter plot of original data with linear regression line');
plt.legend();
plt.show();
```

Notice the different slope for the regression with Huber loss
