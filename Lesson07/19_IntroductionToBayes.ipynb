    "So far, we have mostly worked with frequentist statistical methods. Frequentist models make inferences using only data and likelihood model assumptions. There is another class of statistical models with a long and successful history, Bayesian models. In contrast to the frequentist approach, Bayesian models use **prior information** as well as data and likelihood model to perform inference.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the long history, Bayesian models have not been used extensively until recently. This limited use is a result of several difficulties. The need to specify a **prior distribution** of known information has proved a formidable intellectual obstacle and is often cited as a reason for not using Bayesian methods. Further, modern Bayesian methods are often computationally intensive and have become practical only in the past few decades. Finally, the recent emergence of improved software and algorithms has resulted in wide and practical access to Bayesian methods.         \n",

    "## Brief History of Bayesian Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A restricted version of Bayes Theorem was proposed by Rev.Thomas Bayes (1702-1761). Bayes Theorem, was published posthumously by his friend Richard Price. Bayes' interest was in probabilities of gambling games. He was also a supported Isac Newton's new theory of calculus, with his publication, *An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pierre-Simon Laplace published a far more general version of Bayes Theorem, similar to its modern form, in his Essai philosophique sur les probabilités in 1814. Laplace applied Bayesian methods to problems in celestial mechanics. These problems had great practical importance in the late 18th and early 19th centuries for the safe navigation of ships; the cutting edge technology problem of the age.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The geophysicist and mathematician Harold Jefferys extensively used Bayes' methods. His 1939 book, *The Theory of Probability* was in deliberate opposition to Fisher's maximum likelihood methods. The publication of his book set off a feud between Jefferys and Fisher which lasted until the death of both men in the 1970s. The feud resulted in Bayesian methods rarely being taught or used in scientific publications for many decades. Thus, the development and use of Bayesian models was limited in the mid 20th Century.   \n",

    "The battle between Fisher, Jefferys, and their protégés continued for most of the middle 20th century. This battle was bitter and often personal. The core of these argument were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fisher argued that the selection of a Bayesian prior distribution was purely subjective, allowing one to achieve any answer desired.\n",
    "- Jefferys argued that all knowledge is in fact subjective, and that expressing a prior documented the investigator's biases. Further, he argued that choosing a cut-off value or confidence interval was subjective in any event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the philosophical squabbles, Bayesian methods endured and showed an increasing number of success stories. Pragmatists continued to use both approaches. For example, there were some notable success during the Second World War, included:     \n",
    "- Bayesian models were used to improve artillery accuracy in both world wars. In particular the eminent Soviet statistician Andre Kolmagorov used Bayesian methods to greatly improve artillery accuracy. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the 21st Century Bayesian models are in daily routine use. These applications range across the scope of statistical model applications. A few examples include medical research, marketing analytics, natural language understanding, and web search. Bayesian models have found uses in [legal judgements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934658/) when faced with diverse and uncertain evidence.  \n",
    "\n",
    " One of the more interesting 21st Century applications of Bayesian modeling is in management of [search and rescue operations](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/nvpn-sci-sarops/using-probability-in-search-and-rescue-operations-prediction-by-the-numbers/). For example, the United States Coast Guard routinely uses a Bayesian model to find the most likely search locations for vessels in distress, given incomplete and vague reports of location. These methods made global headlines with the successful location of the missing Air France Flight 447. This aircraft had disappeared in little traveled area of the South Atlantic Ocean. Conventional location methods had failed to locate the wreckage, since the potential search area was quite large. Bayesian methods were able to rapidly narrow the prospective search are, and the wreckage was successfully located. The Bayesian modeling methods used are discussed in a [paper by Stone et.al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4720.pdf) and summarized [here](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/bayesian-search-for-missing-aircraft-ships-and-people).

The NUTS sampler eliminates the need for tedious hand tuning. This method represents the state of the art in sampling. NUTS makes MCMC method routinely available for high dimensional problems.   "

Deriving a prior distribution in this manner is sometimes called **empirical Bayes** modeling. Typically, a less informative prior distribution is used than the actual empirical distribution so the model is not overly constrained. For example, if a Normally distributed prior is chosen, the variance might be increased by some factor (perhaps 2x). The empirical Bayes approach is often applied in practice, while some Bayes theoreticians do not consider this a Bayesian approach at all.   \n",

    "## Credible Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we specify the uncertainty for a Bayesian parameter estimate? For frequentist analysis we use confidence intervals, but these are not entirely appropriate. Confidence intervals are based on a **sampling distribution** of some statistic. Given this statistic, the upper and lower confidence intervals are the specified quantiles of the resulting parameter distribution. In Bayesian analysis there is no sampling distribution. Instead, we use a prior distribution along with a likelihood, computed from evidence, to compute a posterior distribution.    \n",
    "\n",
    "What then can we do to specify a range of credible parameter values for Bayesian analysis? We use a concept known as the **credible interval** of the posterior distribution. A credible interval is an interval on the Bayesian posterior distribution with the highest $\\alpha$ proportion of posterior probability. As an example, the $\\alpha = 0.90$ credible interval encompasses the 90% of the posterior distribution with the highest density. Alternatively, the credible interval is often referred to by other equivalent names; **highest density interval (HDI)**, the **highest posterior density interval (HPDI)**, or the **highest probability density (HPD)** interval. These names make sense, since we seek the the densest posterior interval containing $\\alpha$ probability.        \n",
    "\n",
    "For symmetric distributions the credible interval can be numerically the same as the confidence interval. However, in the general case, these two quantities can be quite different.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An example may help your intuition for the concept of credible interval. The code in the cell below uses the analytical solution for the posterior distribution. Based on this distribution, the credible interval is computed, printed and plotted. For reference the confidence interval is printed as well. Execute this code and examine the results.   \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** This code uses a simple first order approximation to find the credible interval of the unimodal Beta posterior distribution. The approximation relies on the fact that the computed value of the PDF must be the same at each of the boundary credible interval. Starting with an initial guess, the confidence interval, the credible interval boundaries are incrementally updated. This approach likely introduces a small amount of bias in the solution, since the actual interval is unconstrained.    "
